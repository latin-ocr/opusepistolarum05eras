[An original letter, autograph throughout, in the Rehdiger collection at Breslau.
Hess printed it from a transcript made by Rud. Gwalther (1519-86) in a copy of
Oec. E.‚ 29 June 1575, before sending the original to Jac. Monauius Silesius
(1546—1603), from whom no doubt it passed to Rehdiger (1 540-76) 01 his successor&

Ι11 the notes there it is suggested that the invitation to Erasmus to come to Zurich
was the outcome of Hummelberg's letter to Zwingli of 26 Aug. (Zw. E'2. 2 32), but
that this letter probably precedes Ep. 1315. The mouth-date, which obviously
needs correction, should therefore be put between those two limits. 5, which is
unmistakable in the MS„ is perhaps a miswriting for 3; or Erasmus may have
calculated in September as for October. Either of these views seems to me easier
than to suppose that he added Nonas to 5 through inadvertence.

Since his correspondencc with Erasmus in 1516 (Epp. 401, 404) Zwingli’s position
had greatly changed. He had then just been appointed ‘ plebanus ’ of Einsiedeln
in addition to his duties at Glarus ; and though speaking freely about the Church,
he was orthodox enough to become ‘ acolyte-chaplain ’ to the Pope, 1 Sept. 1518.
In Dec. 1518 110 was appointed ‘ plebanus ’ in the Great Minster at Zurich, and there
his reforming principles developed rapidly. He encourages] the town council
to lead the citizens of Zurich in revolt against the Bishop of Constanee on the
questions of fasting and celibacy of the clergy‚ and to withstand the friars about the
intercession of the saints: on which points he had now won signal victories‚ all
in 1522, sealing his triumph with his Archeteles (Ep, 1315. 111). Ηο had also
played a leading part in the negotiations with the Papacy which led to the isolation
of Zurieh from the other Swiss cantons in 1522 : cf. Ep. 1282 introd. See a very
concise statement in B. J. Kidd’s Docuwwms of the Contz'nenlal ReformatIOn, 1911,

Ego mundi ciuis esse cupio, communis omnium vel peregrinus magis.

minus blaterent in me et libros meos que velint.
