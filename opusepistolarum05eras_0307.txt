1357] TO BERNARD OF CLES 275

at Vienna. It was first printed by B. Bonelli, Monumenta ecclesiae Tridentinae,
1 6 ‚ iii. 2, . 192.
7Tshe year-{iate is amply confirmed by the mention of the Paraphrases.

Bernard of Cles (29 March 1485—29 July 1539) was now Ferdinand's most
trusted adviser. He came oi an ancient family, who were lords of the castle of
Cles or Gless in the Val di Non, 20 ms. N. of Trent. After education for three
years at Verona, he matriculated at Bologna in 1504, was proctor of the German
nation 1508, and Dr. of Laws 15 May 151 1 ; having taken deacon’s orders in 1509,
and afterwards received a canonry at Trent. He returned from Bologna to enter
the service of the Bishop of Trent, and by 1512 was Arehdeacon there and proto-
notary apostolic. In 1514 he was summoned to Innsbruck as councillor to Maximi-
lian (cf. ΕΕ. 164, BRE. 288) ; and on 12 June was elected Bishop of Trent, though
the Dean, Banisius (Ep. 700). contested the see. In 1516 he was appointed Im-
perial Governor of Verona. His politica] ability rapidly made him one of the fore-
most statesmen of his day. Ferdinand, whose service he entered, relied upon him
completely from the first; and made him President of his Privy Council in 1526
and Supreme Chancellor in 1528. His later years were largely spent in diplomatic
negotiatione. Clement vn created him Cardinal in March 1530 ; and in Jan. 1539
he was appointed administrator of the see of Brixen. He beautified the town of
Trent and enlarged the castle3 and his care for its government is shown by
a volume of Statum ciuilia ciuitatis Trz'denti, Trent, M. Fracacinus, 10 Dec. 1528,
issued under his direction (see J. A. Tomaschek in Arch. f. szde deferr. Gesch.-
Quellen, xxvi, 1861, 71—83).

To Erasmus he was a consistent patron ; wishing him to come and live with him
at Trent, Erasmus responded by dedicating to him an edition of Irenaeus, Basle,
Froben, Aug. 1526. From other scholare, too, he received numerous dedications :
Clement's Recoqnitiones, Basle, Bebel, Aug. 1526, from sichardus, whose research
for manuscripts he sedulously fostered; Prouerbiorum Symmicla‚ Vienna, Vietor,
March 1529, from J. A. Brassicanus (Ep. 1146); Tacitus, Basle, Froben, 1533,
from Beatus Rhenanus (BRE. 288) ; Balbus’ Oratio from Sauromanus (Ep. 1342.

and his interest in learning is shown by a manuscript of historical miscellan-y,
including the Notitia Diyndatum, which he had copied from one in the Chapter
Library at Spires, when there with Ferdinand for the Diet in 1529 (Lat. 3102,3
in the Nationalbibliothek at Vienna : see Endlicher's catalogue, 1836, nos.
331,2). Much of his correspondence survives in ms. in the Staats-Archiv at
Vienna: see an article by K. Stegmann in Sitzumysberz'chle of Vienna Academy,
xxiv, 1857, 159-239, 011 1110 letters from Andrea del Burgo (Ep. 1297. 53n), 1515-
