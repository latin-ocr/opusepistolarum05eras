1511] FROM JACOPO SADOLETO 573

palace, he addressed a letter of consolation on the death of the Bp.‘s mother
(see K. Morneweg, J οΙι. von Dalbery. 1887, pp. 297—300). He enjoyed the patronage
of Card. Oliv. Caraffa († 151 1), and later of Card. Fed. Fregoso ; receiving in 1503
a canonry in S. Lorenzo in Damaso, and earning a reputation for high character and
elegant scholarship. On the discovery of the Laocoon in 1506 he composed a poem,
which was much admired in his own day and was reprinted by Lessing. While
a student at Ferrara he had formed the acquaintance of Bembo, like himself an
accomplished Latinist; and in 1513 they were together appointed secretaries by
Leo x on his accession. During this period he was a member of the Roman
Academy (see Ep. 1479. 19n) and of the Oratory of Divine Love.

In 1517 Leo gave him the see of Carpentras near Avignon, but would not spare
him from Rome. Adrian VI did not continue him as secretary ; and thus in April
1 52 3 he was free to go to his diocese. Clement vn on the day after his election, 19 Nov.
1523, summoned him to resume his old office ; but in April 1527 set him once more
free. Sadoleto thus escaped the Sack of Rome, but did not evade misfortune:
for on the voyage from Civitavecchia his library was lost. Settling at Carpentras,
he gave himself wholeheartedly to his duties, protecting his people from military
aggression and providing for their religious and educational needs. Francis 1
sought to attach him to France ; but his obligations were to Rome. From 1536 to
1 5 38 he was engaged there with Contarini, Caraffa, Giberti and others on a confer-
cnce for reform of the Church ; receiving the cardinalate in Dec. 1536. Though able
to return at intervals to his beloved Carpentras, he had to spend most of his remain-
ing years in Rome ; and there he died.

His duties as secretary left him small leisure for study ; and thus he published
little till his commentary on Ps. 51 in 152 5. This was followed by another on
Ps. 93 in 1530, a treat-ise De liberis recte instituendis 1 53 3, and a commentary on
the Epistle to the Romans 15 3 5. Many of his letters, private as well as official,
exist in ms. or in print. A few appeared in Lo. E.. 1524; and after his death
there were many collected editions. See a life by S. Ritter‚ Rome, 1912, printing
an unpublished work, De peccato oriqiozali3 and Sad. E. The educational treatise
has been translated by E. T. Campagnac and K. Forbes, Oxford‚ 1916.

The correspondence which Erasmus had initiated at this time on behalf of
Botzheim. was resumed in 1528 ; and the friendship was confirmed by an exchange
gf pilitblications. In 15 32 Erasmus dedicated to him an edition of Basil in the
