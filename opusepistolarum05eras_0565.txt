14811509 ΤΟ JOHN MATTHEW GIBERTI.

Basle.
2 September 1524.

Opus Epistolarum p. 808.
N. p. 771 ι Lond. xxi. 5 ; LB. 694.

[The series of letters, Epp. 1481—98, are mainly concerned with the dispatch to
patrous and friends, of Erasmus’ book with which he had at length joined issue
with Luther, the De libero arbitrio (Ep. 1419). If the mouth-date of Ep. 1479 is
the date of writing, and not merely the date of dispatch, the completion of the
printing of the book, which is of no great length, can be defined within narrow
limits. But on this point there must be some doubt: for Herminiard notes
(121n) that on 2 Sept. 1524 Peter 'rossa-nus (Ep. 155911) reports to Farel from Basle
that Erasmus ‘ rescripsit Datario ’—a fact which very likely indicates that this
letter and others of the same series were written in advance, and dated when the
book was read ‚

The first voslumes available were sent, as was natural, to Rome: cf. also
Ep. 1511. 1, 16nn. But as with the Paraphrase on the Acts (Ep. 1414), transit
appears to have been slow, or at least delivery was delayed ; for Pastor (x. 337,
n. 3) quotes from the Papal Accounts of 24 Oct. 1524, ‘ 10 duc. a vno chorier che
porto vno libro di Erasmo a S. Sta '——though Ep. 1509 shows that the book had
actually been presented a few days earlier. The next copies were sent with a large
budget of letters to England; others to Saxony‚ with letters to the two dueal
courts and to the Universities of Wittenberg and Erfurt. For the reception of the
book at Wittenberg see Ep. 1500. 4²³3, ME. 288, Oec. E., f. 176 (169), Oce. E. ii.
11 : at Strasburg and Cologne it aroused great indignation (LE2. 847).]

ERASMVS ROTEROD. IOANNI ΜΑΤΤΗΑΕΟ GIBER-TO, CLEMENTIS VII.
DATARIO, EPISCOPO VERONENSI, S. D.

SOR1PSI pridem per Ennium, episcopum Verulanum, nec dubito
quin, vt vir ille semper nostri se declarauit amantissimum, praestiterit
ne vel fidem vel diligentiam in ipso possim desiderare : attamen
quoniam in rebus humanis varii casus incidunt, nactus hunc mihi

probe notum Hermannum Blauium, eiusdem epistolae exemplar5

mitto denuo. In prioribus litteris erratum erat in titulo tui nominis,
In iisdem adiunxeram quaedam manu mea, satis libere, sed quae
dicas non omnino temere dicta, si spectes statum Germaniae : quam
vix possum oratione depingere. Mitescerent, opinor, si mox
quaedam relaxarentur. Si res tentetur saeuitia, nescio quem exitum
sit habitura ε et tamen sunt complures in hac fabula, qui nihil aliud
conari videntur quam vt omnia tumultu misceant.

Mitto libellum De libero arbitrio ; et eadem ferme aetate e musico
factus retiarius in arenam prodeo, qua Publius mimographus pro-

diit in scenam. Hoc laboris nemini visum est dicare, quanquam 5

eram submonitus vt dicarem Card. Eboracensi. Clamassent ilico

1. Scripsi] In answer to Ep. 1443³ ;
cf. Ep. 1509. 1. The letter does not
survive.

pridem] For an indication of the
interval that this may denote cf. Ep.
1506. 1.

per Ennium] Filonardi: who
since 1522 (Ep. 1282) had frequently
transmitted Erasmus‘ correspondence
with Rome.

5. Blauium] Cf. Ep. 1482. 62 ε
otherwise known to mo. His sut-name
was perhaps that οἱ the well-known

not

Amsterdam printers, Blaeu. Blaw'us
(= blue) is found in Eov. i. 44fin.

6. erratum erat] Cf. Ep. 1054 introd.

14. Publius] Erasmus is here con-
fusing the contemporary and rival
mime-writcrs. Publilius Syrus and
Laberius: of the lat-ter of whom this
story is told by Macr. S. 2. 7. Hc
repeatshis mistakein Ep. 1495. 18 ; but
in Ep. 1522. 17 has set it right: before
Vives’ correction in Ep. 1513. 24—5 had
reached him (ef. Ep. 1531. 21—2).

16. Ebot-acensi] (Ἴ. Ep. 1415. 8811.
