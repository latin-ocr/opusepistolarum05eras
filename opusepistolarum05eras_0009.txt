PREFACE

A FEW words are necessary to record the kind help which for
many years Professor de Vocht of Louvain ‘has given us, and his
kpresent generosity in allowing us to anticipate him. In July
1914, a fortnight before the outbreak of war, he wrote to tell us
of an extremely interesting collection of original and unpublished
letters—mostly written to Francis Cranevelt of Bruges, 1522-8—
which had been placed in the hands of Professor de J ongh
<†6 April 1915) and himself: the printing‚ they hoped, would
begin in September. On the night of 2ss August his courage and
presence of mind carried the letters, down burning streets raked
by rifle fire, into temporary safety ς subsequently with persevering
audacity he rescued them when they might have seemed hope-
lessly lost. These adventures he will narrate himself.

Before very long he sent us word through friends that the
manuscripts had escaped the Sack. Later in the war, when the
frontier was closed, he made copies of the letters we should want,
and dispatched them to England through an underground
channel. But the messenger was caught and nearly paid the
death-penalty, for the importance of the other papers he was
carrying. When Belgium was reopened, Professor (16 Vocht
hastened to send us fresh copies; and in August 1920 showed us
the actual manuscripts in the College du Pape at Louvain, where
we were his guests. Since then he has been endeavouring to
produce his edition ; but the destruction of Belgian presses,
together with the urgent need for directly educational books,
have combined to put unexampled obstacles in his way. Finding
that his edition will take a few more months to complete, he has
very handsomely permitted us to publish for the first 111116 three
letters from his collection (Epp. 1298, 1317, 1435), and to make
use of manuscripts of two others (Epp. 1313, 1505) which improve
the text. Such magnanimity, well befitting one who shares the

name of a most intimate friend of Erasmus (Ep. 133. 103). 11161116
0111 sincere gratitudo.
