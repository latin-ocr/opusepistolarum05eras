TO JODOCUS GAVERIUS 245

1347]
seniculus qui nihil nisi Graece sciebat, iamque in chernibe, vt fit,
alius alii deferret, ego, Vt finirem moram inutilem, arrepta patris
manu Graece dixi ‘ ἡμεῖς δύο γέροντες ’. Mire exhilaratus senex
lauit mecum. Quanquam id temporis haud multo maior eram
Musuro. Musurus autem amplexus Zachariam, iuuenem eximie
doctum, ‘ καὶ ἡμεῖς ’ inquii), ί δύο νέοι ’.

Venetiae vidi Paulum Canalem patricium, iuuenem summis rebus
natum nisi mors illud ingenium terris inuidisset. Is phthisi periit
me illic agente. Aldus Manucius, hospes meus, multis post annis
periit, haud multo minor annis lxx, sed tamen animo ad literas mire
iuuenili. Petrum Cottam vno prandio vidi et audiui tantum,

aetate florenti, pari modestia atque eruditione virum.

248. δύο γέροντες] For a somewhat
similar occasion with Aldus cf. Ep. 868.
83-6.

250. Zachariam] Legrand (i, p. cxxv)
{3i335;?13}¹y0r355¹¹2{1{³5 ..Wiffflnoffffl
a printer at Venice 1499-1500, 1509,
and at Rome 1515—23 : also as a writer
of MSS. The last definite date in his
life is that he completed a fine Ms. of
Stobaeus (New College, Oxford, 270) for
Pace at Rome on 8 Dec. 1523.

252. Canalem] 01·Decanalis(c. 1483—
0. Aug. 1508), a ‘patrician' 01 Venice
where he was a friend of Augurem,
Navagero, and Bembo (Bemb. Ε.,
p. 465) and a member of Aldus* circle
(cf. ΑΕ.). The termination of his
career of brilliant but unremitting
labour is lamented by Erasmus in Adass.
1248 (= 1252 in the Aldine edition of
Sept. 1508) ; but Bapt. Egnatius'
almost extravagant eulogy (Racema-
tiones, Venice, Jo. Taouinus‚ 5 Sept.
1508, capp. 6, 17) speaks of him as still
living. Jo. Pierius Valerianus, op. cit.
(l. 25611), pp. 30—1‚ credits him with
a knowledge 01 Greek and Hebrew, and
also of ‘astrologyff and mathematics;
and states that he was occupied with
an edition of Ptolemy³s geography at
the time of his death: which took
place in the convent of the Camaldu-
lenses at Venice, after a haemorrhage.
[n 1505-6 he made an inaccurate copy
(Palatinus) of the Cod. Marcianus of
Athenaeus, which was used for the
Aldine edition 01 1514, and later by
Casaubon. It is now in Paris. See the
editions of Athenaeus by Schweighauser,
1801, vol. i, pp. lix, lx ; and by KaibeL
1887, vol. i, pp. xiii, xiv. G. Agostini,
Scrill. Viniziani, ii (1754), 549—55, gives
a detailed 1110.

254. Aldus] See Ep. 207 introd. Hc
was about 06 at his death.

256. Cottam] As nothing is known of
Peter Cotta beyond the mention here,
it seems likely that Erasmus is again
at fault with a Christian name (cf. Ep.
1054 introd.) and intended John Cotta
01 Verona, a friend of Aldus and
Aleander in Jan. 1508 (AE. 56). Born
of humble parents at Legnago on the
Adige 25 ms. below Verona, he became
a good scholar and mathematician.
At first he taught in a school at Lodi‚
but later went to Naples and joined the
Academy of Pontanus (†Aug. 1503:
see Ep. 337. 339n), where he perhaps
met Lilius Gyraldus. Some notes by
him on Propertius are found in an
edition of Cat, Tib„ Prop.‚ Venice,
-Jo. de Tridino, 10 May 1500: and to
the edition 01 Ptolemy's Geoqraphffl,
Rome, Bern. de Vitalibus, 1508, he
contributed a revision 01 bk. 7, ch. 6,
on the planisphere, before 8 Sept.
<1506>. After service with nobles 01
the Sanseverino and Cabavilian families,
by Jan. 1508 he had become secretar)
or ‘canzelier ’ to Bart. d’Alviano, the
famous Venetian general (AE. 56; cf.
Sanuto vii. 408, 426) ; and his meeting
with Erasmus perhaps took place during
Alviano’s triumphal visit to Venice
in J uly 1508 (cf. Resp. ad Petr. Cui-sium,
Basle, Froben, 1535, p. 19: LB. x.
1753A). He took part in Alviano's
projected univcrsity at Pordenone;
but on his master's defeat by the French
at Agnadello, 14 May 1509, he too was
taken prisoner and many of his papers
destroyed. He was allowed to act as
messenger to negotiate 101· Alviano's
rclcasc ς but died at the age of 27-8 of
a sever, while intcrcedfflg at- Viterbo
for the help of Julius n—perhaps not
long after 2 Aug. 1509, when his name
disappears from Sanuto (ix. 10). A few
of his poems were printed in collections
with those 01 50111103011113, M. Aut.
