Cessit hinc, nec opinor rediturum; sic rem gessit: ita quondam
¹solent Euangelii praecones.

Admoueram manum operi quod efflagitas, nec solus efflagita&
sed morbus extrema minitans, et alia quaedam quae inciderunt,
coegerunt intermittere. Huic negocio sumam hanc hyemem volente
Deo. Quanquam decreueram posthac a contentiosis dogmatibus
abstinere, ct vertendis Graecis aut profanis argumentis, sed ad
mores 11011 iiifrugiferiS‚ ocium fallere. At in Ratione concionandi
cogor quaedam indicare quae perperam fiunt a quibusdam con-
cionatoribus, tum attingere aliquot theologorum dogmata: tuis
tamen auspiciis accingar.

Richard Bere (very likely of Beer, a hamlet on the edge oi Sedgmoor, 8 ms.
sw. of Glastonbury: near High Ham, which, as Dr. W. Hunt tells me, was one
of the abbey mauors) was elected Abbot of Glastonbury in 149 3 ς and there during
the autumn of 1497, in the ⁶ King's lodgings’, which he had newly built. he
entertained Henry vn, who was marching to crush Perkin Warbeck’s rising 111
the West. As a result, perhaps, of this reception he was sent by Henry (Hall
f. 59 νο.) with Gilbert Talbot and Robert Sherbourn, dean of St. Paul’s
(Ep. 181. 18n), to carry the King's obedience to the Pope (Pius m, elected 22 Sept.
1303), and negotiate a dispensation for Katharine of Aragon to marry Henry.
now Prince of Wales 3 but as Pius died 011 18 Oct„ the ambassadors failed of their
purpose (cf. Bergenroth i. 414). On 18 Feb. 1504 they were again commissioned to
Rome with the same charge (Bergenroth i. 392), and on their way carried the Garter
to the Duke of Urbino (Hall f. 60); an occasion on which Bere very likely
visited the shrine erected for the newly fashionable cult of Loretto (see Ep. 1391
introd.), since on his return he built a Loretto chapel in his abbey church at Glaston-
bury. On 12 May the embassy entered Rome, and tendered Henry’s obedience
to Julius Π, 20 May (Burchard iii. 354-6) : Sherbourn returned in J uly (Bergen-
roth i. 396), but Bere was perhaps detained longer. In 1504 he supplicated for
a divinity degree at Oxford (A. W00d‚ Fasti 12) ; possibly with a view to increasing
his consequence, if he should be sent on embassy again. In 1508 he had a vigorous
controversy with Warham as to the genuineness of the Dunstan relies at Glaston-
