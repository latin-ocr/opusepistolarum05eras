344 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1523

in partnership with the Cracow printer, John Haller; and his name appears
frequently as author or patron among the productioris of the Cracow presses.
In Dec. 1521 hc published three short works on Polish history ; the last of which
De Siqismundi Reqis temporibus, down to 1516 (cf. SE. 235). is a valuable source
ior contemporary events, and tells also much oi his own life.

In 1525 failing health compelled him to abate his travelling activity. On his
estate at Wola Justovska, near Cracow, bought in 1528, he built a fine chateau in
the style of the Italian Renaissance, and formed there a library oi Greek and Latin
books. At Kupierberg in Silesia he had another estate, near the copper-mines
which he worked in partnership with the F uggers and Turzos. He served
Sigismund as administrator oi the salt-mines at Wieliezka‚ and master oi the
mint at Thorn 1 528-3 5 ς and in 1545 116 carried out the re-roofing oi the royal castle
at Cracow. Besides this book of Erasmus others by Valentino Eck, vadianus, and
Mathias de Miechow were dedicated to him. At his request Ursinus Velius versified
the Oratio Domim‘ca, 1524: see also John Eck’s De sacrificio missae, s. 1., 1526.
A Cracow edition of Erasmus’ De conscribendis epistolis, 1523, is addressed to him
by the printers. The friendship with Erasmus now formed, continued on easy
terms ; and on one occasion Decius wrote to him with his left hand when his right
arm was broken (Ep. 1660). He introduced Erasmus to many of his Polish
friends; and in 1532 gave him an annual pension of 20 florins (Basle MS. C. V1⁵.
71, f. 1).
