LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1523

O miseram ingeniorum gloriam, si aliter constatura non est

studiis omnibus renuncio‚ si hac necessario eundum sit.

literariae conditionis, si exiturus liber non sit nisi illiteratorum
auaritiae approbetur : vt Kemponum et Brechtorum et Torrentino-
rum plena sint omnia, Ciceronem vix vnus habeat. Nunquam Deus
55 immortalis tam inique cum studiis egerit, vt aliter exerere 80
nequeant nisi per N. quaestum : quem ego puto in me esse inclemen-
tiorem, quod cum Antuerpiae me aliquot dies latitando elusisset,
nescio cuius pecuniae quae de ratione supererat gratia, dixi ministris
illius defessum esse iam me perferendis ipsius praestigiis et elusioni-
60 bus, quibus me tam impudenter ludificaietur. Valeat gloria, si
tantam importat seruitutem vt vnicum verbum loqui libere non
sinat; cum ii qui gloriam non sectantur, dicant quicquid libet.
Vellem scripsisses an sit Frobenius illa Opuscula impressurus .

Carminaet Epiqrammata, Zwolle‚ P. van
Os, (<c. 1500> Copinger 3446) contain
10111111180011008, 0110 being an epitaph
for Corn. Oldendyck, principal of the
Little Serbonne (†21 July 1492). His
principal work was a commentary on
bk. ii of the Doctrinale of Alexander de
Villa Dei (Ep. 31. 37n); the earliest
known edition of which was printed
at Cologne, H. Quentel, 1 July 1505,
· iam dudum edita ’. As this appeared
in conjunction with the commentary
of Torrentinus 011 bk. i, it seems
likely that Kempo was teaching with
him at Zwolle. His Carmina were
printed again, revised, in an edition
of his commentary, Deventer, Th. de
Borne, 24 May 1513 : so that he was
perhaps still living at that date. See D.
Reichling, Das Doctrinale des Alexander,
1893, pp. cclii, cclxxvi, cccvi.

Torrentinorum] Herm. Torren-
tinus (YBeeke) of Zwolle (†c. 1520) is
said by Hamelmann to have been a
pupi] of Hegius at Deventer (p. 1483).
He joined the Brethren of the Common
Life, and taught in the fifth class oi
their school at Groningen ; where he
came under the influence of Wessel
(†4 Oct. 1489). For the support of
his mother he left the Brethmn, and
returned to Zwolle; where he became
rector of the school. In his later years
his eyesight failed (cf. his letter of
19 March (1508), from Zwolle‚ printed
by Murmellius in the second edition
of a commentary on Jerome's Ep. ad
Niciam, Deventer, Th. de Borne, 1515);
and Alb. Hardenberg (1510-74) records
having seen him led about the streets

by a pupil (Wesseli Opera, 1617, 1⁰. **
v0). It seems that in consequence of
this, Gerard Listrius (Ep. 495) suc-
ceeded him at Zwolle before his death.

He produced many small books for
use in schools, mostly printed at
Deventer: commentated editions of
Vergil‘s Bac. 1492, and Geor-9. 1496, of
Sabellicus' (samana <1498·>, and the
Hymni et Seqaerztiae, s. a. an Eluci-
darius poeticus 1498, with explanation-<3

ma work so successful that it was
re-edited at Utrecht in 1787, and
Italian translations appeared in 1649
and 1712, De yenerz ibus nominum, 8. a.
(for all these see Cam p3bell) and
Orationes familiares ea: Ouidii libris,

earliest known edition of which was
printed at Zwolle‚ A. Kempen‚ 1 March
1504. In this the severity with which
110 excised great numbers of lines, was
much resented by the conservative:
his Apoloyia, addressed to his brother
John, provost of the Praemonstraten-
sians at Haarlem, is printed at the end
oi his commentary. Murmellius (Ep.
838. 211), who was an intimate friend,
dedicated to him Politian’s Rusticus,
