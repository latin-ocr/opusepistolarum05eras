Germany, Prof. Glauning, director of the University Library
at Leipzig, and Pref. H. Schnorr von Carolsfeld‚ director of
the Staatsbibliotmk at Munich, have most obligingly sent
me rotographs of MSS. in their care.

At the moment 01 writing comes the news Of the death, on
20 January 1923, of Dr. C. Chr. Bernouffi, librarian of the
University Library at Basle. From my first visit to Basle
in August 1894 his help was always given to this undertaking
without stint ; and his sound sense and judgement, combined
with his great learning and the genuine friendliness of his
charming personality, made his Library an ideal place to
work in. To the facilities he granted us on our almost
annual visits are due many discoveries of new material, and
also the smooth progress of our work.
