LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1524

substantial additions (cf. ll. 16—17); §⁵000 new words in Curio's (1522), 3‚000 morc

in Gourmont’s (1523).

Froben's prescnt Dz'ctz'onarius shows its dependenoe on the

latter by the incorporation—made at Basle, not by Ceratinus (cf. 1. 22)—-of a
section De Graecorum numeris, which Chacradamus had contributed when 110
took ovcr the work of Du Maine (cf. l. 12n). The second Aldine edition, however,
of Deo. 1524, shows no definite obligations to transmontano publicatione.

Like Epp. 1000, 1334, this preface is specificd by Erasmus in Cat. Luc. (1, p. 39.
29) as one of those which hc wished to be included among his Letters.]

12. Maino] Wm. Du Maine, also
Dumanius‚ († 24 Nov. 1564), of Loudun
in Poitou, was tutor to Budaeus'
children 1519-23 ; and thus there are
many letters to him in BE. In Jan.
1522 Badius dedicated to him an edi-
tion of Cicero’s Letters, acknowledging
help given by him in the correction
of the text. Other scholarly work of
his was to edit Craston’s Greek Lexicon
for a new issue by Gourmont, April

reading. His preface to Francis
Poncher (Ep. 522. mon) recalls happy
autumus spent by them in Budaeus’
villa at St. Maur-les-Fosses (Ep. 435.
136n)‚ where Poncher held the Abbey.
On 10 Dec. 1524 Du Maine received
from the King a canonry at Rouen.
In 1532 (? 1533) he was living in the
household of Jac. Galeotus‚ royal
master of the horse, and was acting
during the illness of the Italian, Bened.
Tagliacarne (Theocrenus), as tutor to
the children of Francis 1 (see Nic. Bor-
bonius' Nuqae, Paris, M. Vascosanus,
1533, fo· αὖ v⁰.); a post to which he
succeeded in 1534, when Tagliacarne
was made Bp. of Grasse (Herminjard
4833 cf. P J. Olivarius’ edition of

Mela, Paris, Ch. Wechel, 1336, dedi-
cated to Du Maine). In 1534 also
Francis created him Abbot of Beauheu,
near Loches in Touraine (GC. xiv, 286).
Among his friends was John Bayard,
abbot of the Benedictines at Issoire
(GC. ii. 3 59; cf. Macrinus’ Hymni,
Paris, R. Stephanus, 1537, pp. 115, 141).

Dolet cites him frequently as one of
the men of learning who constitute the
glory of France; and verses were
addressed to him by his fellow-towns-
man, Salmonius Macrinus, and also by
Nic. Borbonius and Jo. Vulteius. On
20 June 1541, when counsellor and
almoner to Francis' third son, Charles,
duke of Orleans († 1545), he was ap-
pointed to administer the treasury of
St. Hilary’s at· Poitiers. In 1550 110
was ⁴ a libellis‘ or ‘lecteur ’ to Mar-

garet, duchess of Berry (5 June 1523-

14 Sept. 1574), sister of Henry 11; see
Macrinus' Naeuiae, Paris, vascosanus,
1550, tit. v0. and p. 66. In his later
years he composed French poetry, a
volume of which was printed for him
by Vascosanus at Paris in 1556. He
djed at Loches.
