1397. To JOHN FABEP..

Gotha MS. chart. B. 26, f. 17 v⁰ (a). Basle.
Iudicium E. Alberi, f. 6 v⁰ (β). 21 November 1523.
Gotha MS. chart. A. 399, f. 232 (γ).

[The first source (α) is a ms. volume in the Ducal Library at Gotha, written as
far as f. 233 by the hand of Vitus Warbeck (c. 1490—4 June 1534), canon of
Altenburg (Ep. 711. 1811) and an intimate friend of Spalatinus (cf. Mentz in Arch.
f. Reformationsqesch. i. 3. 197 seq ; and Ep. 1128 introd.). The arrangement of
the volume is roughly chronological ; but there is scarcely anything in the portion
written by Warbeck which is later than 1526. It may therefore be inferred that
this copy was made within a year or two of the letter being written.

The second (β) is printed: Iudicium Era-§mi Alberi de Spomfia Erasmi Bote-
rodami, adeoque quatenus illi conueniat cum Μ. Lutheri doctrina, <strasburg
J. Schott ε BEr¹. iii, p. 4), 3. a., a rare volume of eight leaves, which was reprinted
without date by Secerius at Hagenau (HE. pp. 85²³, 86*). Besides the Iudicium
it contains also this letter and LE. 533, LE2. 710, of 1 Oct. 1523. From 1, p. 28.
36 seq. (cf. vol. ii, p. xix) and Ep. 1466. 26, a conjectural date, July 1524, may
be assigned for the publication. Ι have seen only the Hagenau edition.

The thjrd (γ) is in ms, also at Gotha: in Asterius’ volume copied c. 1553 (see
Ep. 872 introd.). Its original was perhaps β, to which it seems nearer than to α.
But it is inaccumte, twice making considerable omissions through a common form
of error. It is printed by Horawitz (ii. 5).

The text of α is on the whole the best ; but its spelling is somewhat barbarous,
following no doubt Warbeok’s own practice rather than Erasmus'. In this point
β is far superior. I have therefore composed a text out of the three sources, adopting
usually the spelling of β.

The year-date is amply confirmed by the books mentioned, and by the death of
Adrian vr. Faber, who had doubtless by this time joined Ferdinand (cf. Ep. 1382.

S„ vir ornatissime. EX tua salutatione, quam mihi per Olpeium
misisti, melius habui: erat enim accurata et veniebat ab amic-o
et per hominem amicum. Spongiarum rursus tria milia sunt
excusa. Sic visum est Frobem'o. Odi ego tales libellos, nec

multum irascor Hutteno ; irascor his qui miserum hunc instigarunt, 3

non ob aliud nisi ob praedam. Non dubito quin se breui prodituri
sint : nam rursus aliquid monstri alitur Argentorati. Lutherus
vehementer execratur Spongiam : eius epistolam ad te misi.
Scripsit et Oecolampadio me esse Moysem sepeliendum in cam-
pestribuS, nec multum tribuendum Erasmo in his quae sunt spiritus,
Haec sunt belli praeludia.
