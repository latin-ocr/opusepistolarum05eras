92. Rufius] Ger. Roussel or Ruffus
of Vaquerie near Amiens is mentioned
by Faber Stapulensis in 1501 as onc
of a number of his friends who were
‘ strennui in hoc almo studio . . iuuenum
moderatores ’ : see Faber’s first edition
oi Aristotle’s Libri Loqioorum, Paris,
W. Hopyl and H. Stephanus, 17 Oct.
1503, f. 78. Ruffus’ first publication
was a commentary on Boethius’ Arith-
metio, 1521 (see Ep. 1187 introd.), and
this was followed by a new transla-
tion 01 Aristotle's Maqna Moralia,
undertaken at the suggestion of Clie-
thove, Paris, S. Colinaeus, 20 Sept.
1522. By 1521 he was, like Faber,
enjoying Briconnet’s hospitality at
Meaux, where he was appointed canon
and treasurer of the cathedral 3 and in
1525 he accompanied Faber in his
retirement to Strasburg. But the sup-
port of Margaret of Valois enabled him
to return. She made him her confessor ;
and besides encouragement from the
King to translate Chrysostom (Lond.
xxi. 51, LB. 855: 24 March 1527) he
an'oyed freedom to preach at the French
C-ourt (cf. LB. App. 372 ε 14 May 1533)
a moderate reform such as was being
advocated by Erasmus: to whom in
his combination of conservative in-
stincts with sympathy for progress hc
bore some resemblance. His royal
patrous gave him the abbeys of
Userche‚ s. of Limoges, and Clairac,
N. of Agen (GC. ii. 592, 943); and
by 1536 (cf. Jo. Vulteius' Epiyram-
mata, Lyons, S. Gryphius, 1536,
pp. 13, 113, 163) the bishopric of
Oleron. But his known interest in
reform aroused opposition‚ and he was
killed, while preaching, by a fanatic.
See Bonet-Maury in Herzog; NBG;
a life by 011. Schmidt, 1845, with some
letters3 and Herminjard. Gams states
that he held Oleron till 1560, and died
in 1568.

An Ant. Rufus Vaccariensis who con-
tributed verses and a preface to books
‘iffli‘zssissy οῗ ’.πῗὶῗὴὲἓ 11ῧὲξεὶᾏέῗῖἓὲ
Chronicon of Sigebert of Gembloux, and
Clicthove’s De mystica numerorum

Pharelli] Wm. Farel (1489—
13 Sept. 1565), ‘ the Evangelist of
French Switzerland ’, belonged to a
good family settled at Fareau, near
Gap in Dauphine. He studied at Paris
under Roussel (l. 92n) and Faber
Stapulensis; and at first was firmly
orthodox. Through Faber's recommen-
dation he was appointed Regent of the
College of Card. Lemoine, and later was
invited by Briconnet (1. 1 1 811) to Meaux 3
but his views became so advanced that
in 1523 he was obliged to leave. Turn-
ing to Basle he was welcomed by Oeco-
lampadius, and c. 29 Feb. 1524 main-
tained some ‘heretical’ theses before
the University (see LE2. 78111). 111
May and June he went with Ant. du
Blet to visit Zwingli at Zurich (Ep. 1 510.
1811) ; and on his return had an inter-
view with Erasmus which caused a
lasting breach between them. In July
he moved to Montbeliard (cf. Epp. 1522.
65, 1534. 22), and preached there until
the spring of 1525 ; when he was again
expelled as a dangerous man. When
Berne declared for reform in Feb. 1528,
he found 8 footing3 and continued to
spread the new doctrines in Western
Switzerland with fiery vigour in spite
of bitter opposition. In Sept. 1536
he persuaded Calvin (10 July 1509-
27 May 1564), when a fugitive from
France, to join him at Geneva as
Reader in Holy Scripture.

97. Dracone] Dreux or Drouet (born
c. 1507), eldest son of Budaeus: some
of whose letters, 1519-21, encouraging
the boy to study, are preserved in
BE1. and BE2. In Jan. 1522 Badius
dedicated to him 811 edition of Cicero’s
Orations. Later Dreux obtained a legal
office under the Crown and married,
his wife’s name being Barbe de Paillart.
On his father's death he remained in
France, and did not accompany his
