444 LETTERS 08 ERASMUS [1524

14431445 FROM MARTIN LUTHER.

N uremberg MS. PP. 299 (ιι). Wittenberg.
LB. 726. <c. 15 April> 1524.

’ [Τ118 original manuscript 01 this letter does not exist, but there are several
contemporary copies; also an early print in Luther' s Ερί8ιοῑαε, edited by Auri-
faber, vol. ii, f. 194, Eisleben, 1565 The two earliest manuscripts are one in the
Nuremberg Town Library (ΡΡ. 299; α), by the hand of Andrew Ruttellius, who
was Pirckheimer’s (†1330) latest secretary, and another in the Ducal Library
at Gotha (Chart. B. 26, f. 115: β), probably made not later than 1526, by Vitus
Warbeck (see Ep. 1397 introd..) In the few places where these two vary, the
text of α 18 usually the better ; but β 1138 the postscript about Camerarius. Other
manuscripts are at Munieh (Camer. 5. 1: Ὗ), and in the Tubingen University
Library (Mi. xi. 2 ε δ). Of these two hands Ι cannot identify either ι δ was repro-
duced in the Sammlunq hiswrwchberahmter Autoqrapken‚ stuttgart, 1845, iii. 101,
under the idea that it was Luther's autograph. At Gotha there is another copy
(Chart. B. 16, p. 709: ε), by a certain Valentinus Bauarus, c. 1549 ; with which
Aurifaber’s text (ζ) shows some connexion. There are also ms. copies at Dresden,
Zwickau and Bamberg (TK. MS. Misc. i, p. 147) which 1 have not seen : of the two
former Enders (LE2. 780) gives collations.

These sources are all inierior, the copyists having frequently made trifling lapses.
But the construction of the text is an easier task than might have been expected;
since the lapses are usually peculiar to one source—not0 always the same—with
all the rest solidly ranged' 111 opposition. Of important variants there are very few.
In order to spare an already overloaded apparatas criticus Ι have omitted cases
of mere inversion arising out of the negligenee of a single copyist3 but where
two agree in inversion there is evidence of possible connexion which 18 worth
preserving. It may be noted that α 18 printed m P, p. 396, with some inaccuracies.
The repetition 01 most of these in LB. shows that Leclerc obtained his text from Ρ·
but ἓὴῗίγὴπθ quite unimportant, being mere depravations, and need not be
recor e ere

As this letter was carried by Camerarius (888 ΕΡΡ. 1466. 17,1496.2³ 1522. 28),
311 approximate date can be assigned: see Ep. 1444. 2n. Luther wrote at the same
time to Oecolampadius(Aurdfaberiid.184v0.· LE·. 781. 5—10): Scripsi Erasmo
optans pacem et concordiam istiusque magnificae tragediae finem: in quod et tu,
3333& {ffi‘zzafiz’bzzffifissssffiss οθὲἰΐὲἕὲῗὲζὲῇἓξαὲἶῖῗ. ωῗ1θᾫᾚοῗὲἕῇἓῗέ
of both letters may be conjectured from Ep. 1445. On 9 May Oecolampadius also
replied to Luther (LE2. 79 3 1 1- -18), ‘Epis tolam tuam me praesente legit Erasmus,
cautius tamen quam vt iudicium deprehendere possem. Opinor autem illum
aduersus te scripturum nunquam, vtcunque tale quiddam olim polliceri ausus
est, oblinens nimirum ora importune indigna exposcentium. Dabimus senio
hominis morosuli, si alicubi mordacior· alioqui si omnes vires contra Christum,
cuius 3818 negotium, exeret, quid proficeret. θ’ ; and again on 15 May (080. Ε.,
f. 200 v0.: LE2. 795. 23—8), ‘Erasmus literarum suarum quas ad te dedit, mentem
qualitercunque mihi nudiustertius indicauit. Respondit nimirum vt ab ipso
expectaui. Ni fallor, non temere in te scripturus, tametsi de Libero Arbitrio opus
tridui paratum se habere affirmet, idque fellis expers.’

It was quickly rumoured in Wittenberg that Luther had written to Erasmus,
‘ nimirum Christiane ² : see a letter of 17 gApril quoted by Enders (LE2. 780, n. 1).
Though Camerarius later was at great pains to convince Erasmus that so long 38
the letter was in his hands, no one else could have seen it (Ep. 1501. 50 seq.)‚
Erasmus on 1118 81(18 80011 made no attempt to conceal its contents3 and allowed
Jerome Lasky (Ep. 1242. 25n) to carry the original into Poland (1, Ρ. 32. 18).
By the end of the year it was in wide circulation, and Erasmus expected that it
would be printed at Strasburg (ΕΡΡ.1496.25,152228-9). No such issue 18
known, but it may easily have perished.

If thi's· 18 the letter to which Luther was referring' 111 his Table- talk‚‘ Eg 0 in ea
epistola quae displicuit Philippo, prouocaui <Erasmum>3 sed noluit meeum con-
gredi' (G. Loesche, Analecta Datherana, 1892, p. 69), it 18 clear that Melanchthon
did not regard it as 001101113101Ὑ.(3811331111)7 Erasmus deelined the challeng e; his
rejoinder in Ep. 1445 avoiding the larger questions at issue between them. ]g
