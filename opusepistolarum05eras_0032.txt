ERASMO ROTERODAMO DOCTISSIMO VRBANVS REGIVS,
THEOLOGO THEOLOGVS, S. D.

TVVM ad nos reditum, Erasme doctissime, Germaniae, immo
Christianis omnibus gratulor. Haud secus enim te expectauimus
ac solem quendam qui tenebras nostrae noctis sit discussurus,
tenebras inquam internas eoque periculosissimas; nam te renas-

scentis theologiae auctorem primum nostris temporibus qui non
fatetur, et mendax est et ingratus. Primus tu a turbidiss<imis>
scholasticorum lacunis ad fontem sacrarum litterarum reuocasti
theologos, idque ea modestia vt admonitione tua tam salubri
tamque necessaria ne inimici quidem sint offensi: praeter nescio
10 quas noctuas abominabiles ac miserabiles pocius quam odio haben-
das. Primo omnium ad theologos veteres hortabaris, a quibus
deinde ceu riuulis ad canonicas Scripturas, fontem limpidiss<imum>‚
nos perduxisti, denique effecisti tantum vigiliis tuis doctissimis

a schoolfellow 01 Matthias Held, the
future Imperial Vice-Chancellor, at
Arlon, his native town. For his uni-
versity course he went to Freiburg,
where he became B.A. c. 28 Sept. 1516,
Μ.Α. 1517, and studied under Zasius.
Some verses by him were printed with
Ph. Engelbrecht’s Carmen Paraeneticum
(Ep. 344. 52n), Basia, April 1517. Ηο
remained at Freiburg for some years,
tcaching Latin and Greek, and became

Francis 01 Sickingen3 and again in
Dec. (1525), when he wrote to Zasius
(ΖΕ. 509-12), saying that he contem-
plated turning to theology. About

01 Hagen, who⁸were related to the Abpbs
01 Treves. In 1531 he migrated to
Paris, where he taught in the Collegc
of St. Barbara, and in 1534, through
the influence 01 Budaeus, was appointed
the first Professor of Latin in the College
de Franco: an office which he held
until 1542, in spite of being at one time

his former pupil, John Louis ο1 Hagen ;
who had become Abp. of Tffives, 1540-
7, and wished to have Latomus as his

councillor. His later years were spent
in the discharge of official duties. 'rho
statement commonly made that he
was bom in 1485, seems improbable
in view 01 the dates 01 his degrees at
Freiburg, and Erasmus' description of
him in Ep. 1342. 214-15, as iuuenis.

His literary output includes numerous
small poems, one 01 which is 011 the
death 01 Maximilian, Augsburg‚ 27 Oct.
15193 treatises on rhetoric and
humanity, and a commentary on Rud.
Agricola. As Ptofessor at Paris he
turned his attention mainly to Cicero,
of whom he produced some annotated
editions: some ms. notes taken at his
lectures on Horace are also extant.
Later, in the controversies 01 the Re—
formation he took a strongly orthodox
line, and wrote several pamphlets.

His acquaintance with Erasmus
began c. 1515 (Lond. xxvii. 27, LB.
1283), and they doubtless met on other
occasions while Erasmus was at Basle.
The poem mentioned here does not
seem to exist.

ii (1750), 554,5 ; a very full notice by
L. Roersch in BN ; Lestanc, pp.
183,4; and a programme by E.
Wolff, Luxembomg, 1902, which I
have not been able to consult.
