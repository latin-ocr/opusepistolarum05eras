LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1523

At solidior est et fides et integritas

Erasmi R0t<er0dami> per orbem, quam vt a similibus, ne dicam

Cognitum est mihi, nec illi

nesciunt qui rumores huiusmodi spargunt impudenter, rem ita se

habere vt scri bis.

Sed quid facient homines desperati, indulgentes

otio, vino, ludo, et id genus virtutum agentes 't

Tragoedia apud nos, de qua scripsi, magnifice a nostris coepta
10 est, sed hactenus a senatu Constantiensi intercoepta, tametsi
Episcopus et senatus, vicissim missis legatis, agant negotium3

sed, vt video, quisque-intentum suum mordicus tenet.

Episcopus

pretextu alieno, nempe ob mortem Zuicci, quondam apud Mers-

purgum praefecti sui, reliquit Constantiam.

Interea plus satis

vehementer agunt Suffraganeus, Michael Sanderi, et nonnulli aljj,
Episcopi nomine, apud senatum Constantiensem: quos quanto
video vehementiores, tanto indies sentio maiori granatos odio

 

8. virtutum] Cf. Ep. 1211. 123n.

9. Tragoedia] The Bp.'s attempt to
get rid of Wanner (Ep. 1 335 .4411); about
which Botzheim had written in Ep.
1382. 36 seq.

11. Episcopus] See Ep. 1316. 12n.

13. Zuicci] Evidently a household
steward: perhaps a kinsman of the
Reformer, John Zwick. The identifica-
tion suggested in ΕΕ, p. 450, seems to
be disproved by Bl. E. 36.

Merspurgum] Meersburg, opposite
Constance on the N. side of the lake3
where the Bp. had a castle, restored by
him in 1508 (G. Bucelinus, Coras-tantia
Rhenana, 1667, p. 337). He rctircd
thither in 1526, and there he died and
was buried.

In a volume at Schlettstadt (Cat.
Rhen. 370: Cic. Epist„ Venice, Aldus,
1 5 12, inscribed ‘ Sum BeatiRhenam', nec
muto dominum. Basileae, M.D.XH1 ')
are 17 verses copied on the last cover,
by a hand which is perhaps Beatus’.
They are bea-ded ⁶ Erasmi Roterodami ’
and dated M.D.xxn1; and are cast in
the form of a ‘commoda domus ² invit-
ing its visitor,

‘Agnosce dominum qui tenet me et
condidit.
Mores suos expressit hac imagine.

Is ‘me nouauit, auxit, expoliit 3· meo·
Baro Iohannes inclytus cognomine.
Si vgtgpis et illud nosse, Merspurgum

So far as Ι know, the verses have not
been printed. Erasmus may have seen
Meersburg during his visit to Constance
in Sept. 1522 (see Ep. 1315 introd.).
15. Suffraganeus] EE. p. 416 iden-
tifies with Faber, who is mentioned in
this connexion in Ep. 1382. 27—9: but

there seems no ground for stating, as
in Ep. 386 introd., that he was ever
Suffragan. That office was now filled
by Melchior Fattlin or Vechtlin († p.
11 July 1548) of Trochtelfingen or
Truchtelfingen, both villages in Swabia,
not far from Sigmaringen and in the
diocese ot Constance. After education
at Freiburg (matria 23 Feb. 1508, MA.
1511), during which he maintained
himself by teaching in the town-school,
he was ordained in 1514; and by his
preaching soon made a name which
brought him invitations from outside.
In the summer of 1518 110 accepted the
suffragan bpric. at Constanoe, with the
title of Bp. of Ascalon 3 and on 19 Oct.
was made D.D. at Freiburg.
a vigorous opponent of the Reforma-
tion. Just at this time he attacked
Luther (cf. Bl. E. 603 printed in Latin
in MHE. iii. 58); and in 1526 110 pro-
duced a treatise against communion in
both kinds, which was printed by
F. Morhart- at Tubingen. On 10 May
1527 he presided at the execution of
John Hiigle of Lindau, who was burnt
for heresy at Meersburg. When the
Chapter fled from Constance in 1528,
Fattlin, being now Dean, accompanied
them to Ueberlingen, and in 1542 to
Radolfzell. His later years were spent
in study; and some of the books he
collected are now in the University
Library at Freiburg. In 15 39 110 began,
and in 1548 completed, a scheme for
enlarging and re-endowing the College
of St. Jerome, or the ² Carthusian
House ’‚ founded at Freiburg by
Conrad Arnolds (†1485): which was
afterwards destroyed in the Thirty
Years' War. See a life by H. Schreiber,
1832 : also VE. 324 and Bl. E. 52,
Sa-nderi] See Ep. 1242. 2611.
