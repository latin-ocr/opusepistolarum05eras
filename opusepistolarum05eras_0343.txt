[A contemporary copy, not an autograph : in the Ratsschulbibliothek at
Zwickau. Reproduced in faesimile by M. Richter, Deszfderius Erasmus und scine
Stellunq zu lantker, 1907, and again by O. Clemen, Handschristenproben aas der
Reformatiomzeit, 1911, no. 18 ; printed by J. G. Weller‚ inaccurately, in Alces aws

far Zwiokau vii, 1902, p. 32.

The letter does not admit 01 0 precise date, but may be placed conjecturally in
the period when Eppendorff's quarrel with Erasmus was in full progress (cf. Epp.
1371, 1376). Egranus, 101 whom see Ep. 872. 1211, appears to have been in Basle
at 11113111110; 01. Epp. 1376. 11,31‚ 1383. 1.]

AEGRANO SVO.

S. Plura scripturus eram, sed hic subito discessit. Eppendor-
pius negat omnia de libello edito. Missis ad me literis denunciauit
mihi monomachiam, mox alteris denunciat laqueum. Scribit se
natum ex nobilissimis parentibus, et malle milies mori quam habere
vnam guttulam sanguinis mereatorii. Irascitur tibi quod nescios
quid de ipso scripseris. Dixit Hieronimo, filio Frobenii, ‘ Credo '
inquit, ‘ illum confossum a fratre meo ’. Habet 1110 talem fratrem
qui sie confodiat homines ’Ξ Bene vale. Plura non vacat.

Erasmus tuus.

1378. To ULRICH Zwmem.

Spongia, 10. a2. - <Βο310.>
LB. x. 1631. <August init. 1523.>

[The preface to Erasmus’ Sponyia aduersus asperqines Η caleni, Basle, Froben,
Sept. 1 52 3. The chronology 01 1110 composition 0011 be ascertained with precision.
The Expostzdatio (Ep. 13 56. 6311) was in eirculation in the first half 01 Juiy. By
19 J uly Erasmus had not yet made up his mind whether he would reply or not
(Ep. 1376. 27-8); yet in spite of his recent illness (Ep. 1376. 311) 110 eompleted the
book before t-he end 01 the month (Ep. 1389. 69-70), 111 six days’ work (Sponqza
fin.‚ LB. x. 1672F). In Ep. 1437. 68—71 (01. 1, p. 27. 7—8) he represents that the
decision to publish this (10101100 01 himself was taken on the advme of his friends.
As Froben's presses were occupied, the printing did not start till 13 Aug„ and was
not completed till 3 Sept. (Ep. 1389. 75-63 01. Ep. 1383. 13—14). This pretace was
probably written later than the b00k; but from the continuous paglnatlon 11 3001113
likely that it was not, like many prefaces, deferred till after the book was set
up in type. It may therefore be placed early in August, a date which accords
with the many verbal resemblances to Ep. 1379. . Π

Bocking (HE. pp. 83*—84*) cites more than one issue 01 1110 first edition, and
Ep. 1397. 3—4 probably implies that a great number of copies were prmted.
Almost immediately came the news 01 Hutten's death (see Ep. 1388. 12n) ξ which
impelled Erasmus in a new edition to substitute a new preface (Ep.⁸ 1389) 111 place
of this. A year later, in reissuing Cat. Luc. (cf. Ep. 1437. 143n), he inserted along
explanation of his reasons 101 writing the Sponyia (1, pp. 27—9‚ 30—1).]
