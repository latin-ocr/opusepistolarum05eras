12771312 FROM JOHN VERGARA.

Munich MS„ Heine xvi. Brussels.

24 April 1522.

[For the manuscript, which is an xviii& copy, and for Vergara's correspondence
with Stunica about Erasmus, see App. 15 in vol. iv. The year-date is adequately
confirmed by the contents. The postscript may be dated about the end of the
mouth, for Charlcs finally left Brussels on 2 May (Gachard ii. 32).

John Vergara of Toledo (5 Sept. 1492—22 Feb. 15 57) was perhaps one of the
first students at Ximenes’ newly founded university of Alcala: at any rate he
worked upon the Complutensian Polyglott, for which he revised the current Latin
versions of Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus, and contributed some verses in praise' of
the New Testament, 10 Jan. 1514, being then M.A. He also took part in a new
translation of Aristotle into Latin promoted by Ximenes, but not completed.
Some letters exchanged by him from Alcala c. 1511—12 with Alfonso Segura at
Salamanca are printed in Marin. Ε., ff. m⁵ v0—n2. He was secretary c. 1516—17
to Ximenes, from whom he received a canonry at Alcala: but on his patron's
death he went to the Netherlands with Alonso Valdes to inform the new Abp..
W. Croy (Ep. 647 introd.), about the affairs of his diocese. The archiepiscopal
archives at Toledo contain some autograph notes by him of Croy's acts and corre-
spondence. During this period he met Erasmus (cf. Ep. 1128. 4n) at Bruges
(Ep. 1129. 1n; cf. vol. iv, p. 623) and later at Louvain (l. 3). Subsequently he
was attached as chaplain to Charles' court; with whom he returned in 1522 to
Spain (Record Office, S. R, Henry vm, xxiv, f. 181 : abridged in Brewer iii. 2288. 4).
Thence on 6 Sept. he transmitted to Vives the invitation to succeed Ant. Nebris-
sensis at Alcala. From the autumn of 1 52 3 to the summer of 1524 he was settled

Scheffer dates (a. 29 April> 1522
