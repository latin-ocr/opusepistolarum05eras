262 LETTERS OF ERAsMus [1523

to Riegger for ZE (γ), imagining it to be an autograph original (ZE. p. 300n).
J. Neff, U. Zasius, ii, 1891, p. 35, prints a collation of β and 73 which is, however,
not exhaustive. An examination of the variants recorded below shows that the
text of a, though often better than that of ΒὙ, 18 by no means accurate throughout.
In some places the writer of β, while copying, has corrected it; and in others
Sinner has made some drastic emendations, besides correcting sporadic deprava-
tions which appear in Β. The insertion of Varenbuler’s name (l. 2 36) and of two
other passages (ll. ς 3, 242), together with a number of improved readings elsewhere,
perhaps denotes that the writer of β had access to the original manuscript from
which α was printed; but as α is undoubtedly prior in time to β, it may take
preceidence herc. In view of its evident inaccuracy I have not hesitated to emend
it sti l further.

The connexion with Epp. 1343, 1344, 1352 confirms the year-date; and there
is a clear reference (l. 160) to the morrow after Passion Sunday (but see 1. 162n).
Besides thus showing the mouth—date, this reference also gives demonstrable
evidence (instead of inferential z cf. Ep. 480 introd.) of a case of the error of writing
in the date the present instead of the coming mouth.

This letter was written shortly after a visit which Erasmus paid to Freiburg,
in response to pressing invitatione received z cf. Epp. 1252, 1316. 37. He was not
Zasius‘ guest, but stayed in the Ship Inn3 where the University authorities on
9 March sent him a present of a silver cup (H. Schreibcr, Gesch. cl. Univ. Freiburq,
1868, ii. 28n). The magistrates also made him some complimentary offering
(1. 30411). 111 the colloquy Iclzthyoplzaqia (first printed in Feb. 1526: LB. i. 805 B-E)
he states that the visit lasted only a few days 3 and describes with evident amuse-
ment, as here, the excitement created because Zasius, entertaining him at his
house before departure, set before him chicken to eat, although it was Lent. By
11 March he had returned to Basle (Ep. 1348).

Erasmus’ reason for not publishing this letter may perhaps be found in the
freedom with which he handles subjects of acute controversy, and especially in
his very outspoken utterances about his master, the Emperor (ll. 103-10).]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS SVO ZASIO.

ADVOLAVIT huc aurula quaedam rumoris, vani, vt arbitror, te
vocatum in ius, coactum fuisse causam dicere, quod Erasmo pullum
appararas3 et cum tantus sis iureconsultus vt possis etiam in
difficillimis causis patrocinari reis, tamen non alio colore absolutum

5 fuisse quam quod per diploma Pontificis id facere liceret. Proinde
scire cupio verumne sit quod huc perlatum est. Nam mihi sane
non fit verisimile. Primum enim miror quis corycaeus sycophanta
nidorem eius pulli detulisset ad Senatum. Deinde non arbitror
quenquam in Senatu esse tam inciuilem vt, eum ego isthuc profectus

nomine, mihi voluerit 1100 labis aspergere, et hoe velut honorario
munere donatum dimittere. Tu sent-iens, opinor, me periclitari de
calculo et ideo maturare abitum, clam ae me inscio domi tuae
pararas pullum gallinaceum. Hoc vnicum erat humanitatis tuae,
15 qua non minus admirandus es, mi Zasi, quam eruditione, qua cum
paucis es suspiciendus. Ipse tamen, vt scis, abstinui, teque obiur-
gaui quod plus satis humanus id mea causa fecisses, vnde nasci
poterat nonnihil tragoediae. Sentiebam me calculo grauidum, et
omnino decretum erat abire 3 et ideo, ne rursus multis confluentibus
20 cogerer diutius accumbere in conuiuio et mox ventre onusto equitare,
