12551270 To CHARLES V.
Paraphrasis in Euang. Matthaei, f0. A2. Basle.
Lond. xxiX. 67 : LB. vii, κ’. ss * v0. 13 January 1522.

[The preface to Erasmus' Paraphrase 011 St. Matthew—a work which had been
suggested to him by Schinner in June 1521 (cf. Ep. 1248. 1411). 011 reaching
Basle he carried cut the task, ⁴ praeter animi propositum ’ (Ep. 1581) ; and was
occupied with it for one or two months (cf. l. 82n). On 7 March 1522 the book
was still in the press (Ep. 1264. 15-16)ε by 21 March it was out (Ep. 1267. 30).
For its reception at Brussels and the letters that it brought Erasmus see Epp. 1269,
1299, 1300, 1302, 1331, 1342, and 1, p. 44.3—9. A copy was sent by Boniface
Amerbach to Zasius ((c. 2 April>1 Basle MSS. C. V‘Ia. 73. 328, 349); and on
14 April Zasius aoknowledged its arrival (ZE. 36). Among the manuscripts of the
Basle Library (Frey-Grynaeus Π. 9. 137) is a contemporary German translation
of this preface. It is dated 18 Jan. (achtenden)‚ which is perhaps only an error of
the translator, misreading 3 into 8: but cf. the divergent date of the transla-
tion οἱ Ep. 939. The year-date needs no confirmation.

Of the Paraphrase there are the following Froben editions z a folio of 15 March
1522 (α); octavos of March 1522 (β), s. α. (γ), and 1523 (δ), the two latter being
‘ nunc denuo recognita ³ ; a folio of 1524 (ε), which seems to have been set up from
a, and containing the paraphrases of all four Gospels ⁶ ab ipso autore recognitae ' ;
an octavo of 1534 (ζ), and a complete folio of 1535 (η), each of these two volumes
being ‘ nunc postremum ab autore recognitus ’. As Ep. 1270 appears for the first
time in δ, it seems likely that γ was printed shortly after β, 111 April or May 1522.

To fill the opening sheet (a), which evidently was printed after the rest of
the book, Erasmus contributed an ‘appendix ’ (cf. Ep. 1581) in the form of
a letter, addressed to the reader and dated 14 J an. 1522, but too long to
print here. Its purpose was to maintain, as he had done in the well-known
