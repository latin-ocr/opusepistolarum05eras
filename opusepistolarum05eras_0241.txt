326. Coricius] John Coricius (⁴3Goritz)
of Luxemburg († c. 1527 fin.), a cleric
and jurist, who in May 1497 was in the
employ of the Curia (Burchard ii. 377 :
cf. 482, 539, also Balan p. 325) and
served under six Popes. In his later
years his house and vineyard near
Trajan's Forum was the resort of the
poets of the Roman Academy3 to
whom on St. Anne's day, 26 July, he
gave an annual festival. At this
Aleander was a guest in 1516 : see his
Journal, ed. Omont, 1895, p. 17. About
1 514 Sansovino erected for him a chapel
in St. Augustine’s church, with a fine
altar group containing St. Anne.
Poems addressed to the ‘ Ara Cori-
ciana‘ are mentioned in MHE. ii. 33
of Feb. 1515 (cf. id. iv. 7); and in July
1524 Blosius Palladius edited a volume
of Coryciana, Rome, L. vicentinus.
containing besides these poems one
letter of Coricius himself. In 1520
Coi-icius was named by the Dominicans
