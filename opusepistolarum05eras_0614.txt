[The manuscript is an autograph rough- (113111 by Sadoleto 111 1110 V 3110311 Archives.
The letter was twice printed 111 Ε135111115, 111 H and again, at the very end of 1115
1110, 111 M: in both cases with 1031· ·date and p-laee date added. and no doubt
from the same original, the letter which 110 113(1 Ρ30111311)γ received. The texts of
H and M differ ineight readings, but only one (l. 23) 15 50110115 enough to constitute
a blunder; so that 11 15 1101 clear 10)11 110 should have troubled to print the letter
again. Such scrupulous care for 1110301οἀ11 of a friend' s Latinity was 1101 011(1 1110
51311(131(15 of an age which left the correction of proofs to hirelings. The repetition
was perhaps therefore a mere oversight.

The texts of H and M 310 both reproduced in N. To distinguish them I have
on this occasion adopted the. siglum 11 for the later text, whjche, repiesents M: in
1110 sequence of sigla it follows N. It 15 noticeable that n produces three deprava-
tions of its own. OIn Lond. also the text is gix en twice, from N and n: and LB
follows n, no doubt leprinting from Lond. But in order not to overload the
critical notes Ι have dropped there all reference to these two editions which are not
contemporary.

The y ear· date added in H and M is contii med by that of Ep. 1555 for the month-
