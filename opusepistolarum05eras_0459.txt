ΤΟ JOHN DE HONDT 423

1433]

as it was in Ep. 1434. 61 z the two letters may well have been sent off together.
Ep. 1471 shows that de Hondt repudiated the suspicions here raised]

HONORABILI DOMINO IOANNI DE HONDT, OANONICO CURTRACENSI, S. P.

viM alterae vestrae iam obsignatae mansissent aliquae apud
me, venerunt litterae 0 F landria scriptae a Michaele quodam
Bentino‚ quae nunciabant te inimicissimo esse in me animo, ac
iuuenem quendam, qui nescio quem meorum libellorum haberet,
aeriter obiurgasse quod haeretica legeret ; addens meos libros esse
pestilentiores LutheraniS‚ teque sperare breui futurum vt ego 011111
meis libris comburerer. Non dubito quin haec sint conficta, nisi
tu aut plane versus es in alium hominem, aut prorsus ignores
quantum malorum hic sustineam a LutheraniS.

Ego puto mortem esse leuiorem his quae patior. Et si nouissem
statum huius coniurationis, maluissem ad Turcas demigrare quam
huc. Aliter iudicauit Adrianus Pontifex de libris meis, qui theo-
logis frustra de me blaterantibus imposuit silentium. Aliter
Cardinales, qui Stunieae talia de me scribenti indixere silentium :

quod nuper iterum fecit Clemens VII. Aliter Cardinalis Campegius, ς

1. alterae vestrae] An important
letter, addressed to de Hondt, about the
payments of Erasmus’ pension from his
Courtray prebend : written before this,
but not yet dispatched. Not extant.
Cf. Ep. 1458. 2, 15.

(cf. Ep. 1460 introd.). Later he went
to seek his fortune at Zurich and
Lyons (Herminjard 153, 164); but
returned disappointed to resume his
work with Curio. He contributed some
notes on Nic. Perottus’ Cornucopia.

2. Michaele] Bentinus, Bentius‚ or
Bentinius, of Flanders (Herminjard
103), was working for Froben in 1520,
and corrected for the press new edi-
tions of Erasmus' Gaza, Feb. 1521
(Epp. 428, 771) and Adaqia, Oct. 1520
(BRE. 58, 166; cf. Ep. 1437. 160-5‚
and VE. 226) : for his position in the
firm cf. Ep. 1437. 43. An epigram of
Ursinus Velius (Poemata, Basle, Froben,
March 1522, f0. x³) congratulates him

Pelican. Before this visit to Flanders,
during which he visited Livinus Am-
monius at Bois St. Martin (Ep. 1463),
he was in sympathy with the Reformers;
and now on his return attached himself
to Farel, through whom 110 attempted
to find his way to Brieonnct’s circle
at Meaux (see Ep. 1407. 92, 1181111).
Another project was to start with
Anemund Coct a press which should
produce French translations of the
,Gospcls (HerminJ'ard 103, 120). With
Oeeolampadius also and the Strasburg
Reformers he established relations
(ibid. 181—5). About Nov. 1524 he
married (Epp. 1514, 1548), and began
to work in the press of Val. Curio
at Basle: whom he helped with his
second Lexicon Graecum, March 1525

Varro’s De analoffla, Pomp. Festus and
Nonius Marcellus, Sept. 1526; and
edited Horace with Acron's com-
mentary, with a preface 1 April 1527.
addressed to his old companion in
Froben’s press‚ Conrad Heresbach
(see Ep. 1316). About 20 Nov. 1527
110 died of the plague at Basle, following
his wife and child (Oec. E„ f. 201=
Herminjard 207; cf. Lond. xix. 51,
LB. 939, 1 March 1528). His last under-
taking was to edit Cicero in 3 vols. fol..
for Cratander; who in the profane,
13 March 1528, to vol. i, f0. α’, deplores
the young man's untimely death in the
most heartfelt language.

His notes on Varro mention a friend
Perpetuus Henriotus, and extol Eras-
mus as ⁴ amor et delitiae humani
