118 LETTERS or ERASMUS [1522

omission by printing, at the end of the whole undertaking, the bare text—a volume
of 492 peges instead ot the 810 of 1522, and with much less variation of type.

Though the correspondence of Erasmus and Vives shows no ill-feeling over this,
traces of it may be noticed in another edition of Augustine, produced at Paris by
Cl. Chevallon in 1531. The general preface of this, by J ames fiaemer of stuttgart,
17 Oct. 1531, states that four years before (very likely on hearing of the death of
Froben) Chevallon had proposed to Erasmus a new edition of Augustine : but that
Erasmus had replied that he was bound in honour to Froben's successors. Chevallon
wanted, however ς and when their edition appeared in 1529, he used it as the basis
of a new edition carefully revised with the aid of MSS. borrowed from St. Victor’s
at Pan's. The fifth volume is again appropriated to the De Ciuitate Dei3 but
instead of the plain text as given in the Froben volume of Dec. 1529, it cont-ains
vivcs’ preface to Henry ΠΗ, Henry’s reply, which had not before been printed,
other introductory matter, and all Vives' notes. A significant¹ change is that in
Vives’ preface to the reader the page of eulogy on Erasmus (cf. Ep. 1303. on) is
cut down to a line or two of formal acknowledgement. Subsequent Froben editions
oi 1543, 1555, 1569, follow Chevallon's in these points. It therefore seems not
unlikely that the treatment of Vives in this matter may have caused temporary
unpleasantness with Erasmus 3 ef. Ep. 1 222 introd. F urther light may be gathered
from a letter ot Erasmus, 22 Aug. 1534 (printed by⁴ Bliashowski in J b f. I’hilosophie

et opus immensum est, et nemo lectu molestior quam Augustinus, praesertim in
his quae scripsit per ocium accuratius. Tentaui, quo gratificarer amico, sed animus
abhorruit. . . . Scripsi illi . . me non posse praestare quod cupit ’. Cf. EE2. 76;
where Longlond expresses his disappointment at not having Erasmus’ work on
the De Ciuitate Dei.

In the selection of Augustine’s ‘ great apologetic treatise in vindication oi
Christianity and the Christian Church ’ to appear in advance of the rest, Erasmus
and Froben were doubtless not unaware of the popularity which it had enjoyed,
especially in the early days of printing. Sweynheym and Pannartz printed it
three times by 1470 3 twenty—four editions are known before 1496, and since 1500
there had been three more. It had been translated, t00; into Italian in 1473 (four
times reprinted by 1500), and into French in 1486-7. There is no English version
till Healey’s of 1610, which translates also Vives' notes. For More's interest in
this treatise of Augustine ef. Ep. 999. 158—9.]
