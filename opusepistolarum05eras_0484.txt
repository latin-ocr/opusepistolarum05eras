448 LETTERS OF ER-ASMUS [1524

144322. FROM JOHN MATTHEW GIBERTI.

Vatican MS. Particolare 154, f. 7. Rome.
20 April 1524.

[Α11 autograph rough-draft among Giberti’s papcrs in tho vatican Archives.
The year-date is sufficiently confirmed by the reference to the recent elevation of
Giberti's master to the Papaey. The person addressed is without doubt Erasmus.
To no one else could a supporter of the Pope have written with such admiration
for his services in bringing politc learning into Germany and ior promoting sacred
studies. This letter probably accompanicd the second dispatch of Ep. 14 38
on 30 April. Erasmus' reply is not extant, but is mentioned in Ep. 1481. 1.

John Matthew Giberti (20 Sept. 1495-30 Dec. 1543) was the natural son of
a Genoese sea-captain, afterwards in Papal employ, and a Sicilian woman. His
early years were spent with his mother at Pa-lermo ; but his father summoned him
to Rome, and after a course of university study obtained him a place in the house-
hold of Cardinal Julius de' Medici, later Clement vn. This position gave the young
man opportunity to join the Oratory of Divine Love ; many of the members of
which belonged also to thc Roman Academy. His ability and character gained him
the confidence of his patron, and the Cardinal' s connexion with Leo x brought
Giberti into touch with affairs of the highest importance. Immediately on ghis
accession Clement vn made him his datary, and for some years employed him
continually in diplomacy. At the Sack oi Rome in 1527 Giberti suffered great
indignities, as Clement’ 8 representative, and nearly lost his life.1n 1528 110 was
at length allowed by the Pope to leave Rome and undertake. in Feb„ the guidance
of the see of Verona, to which he had been elected in Aug. 15 24. His conduct
there was exemplary, and has been compared to the paternal³ sway of Sadoleto
(see p. 573) at CarpentraS. In face of bitter opposition he set himself to impose
stricter life upon his clergy, and to promote reform of all kinds among the laity.
He also encouraged learning, and founded a press in his palace, from which he
designed to produce an edition of Chrysostom in Greek (cf. Lond. xxv. 2 3, xxiv, 19 ;
LB. 1135, 1197). In 1536, in company with Contarini, Caraffa, Sadoleto, Pole
and others, he was summoned to Rome to join the Papal commission instituted
for the purpose of reform : and between that and the care of his diocese his last

REVERENDE domine, tanquam frater honorande. Etsi ego antea
tuam virtutem colui semper, propterea quod vni maxime tibi
politiorum literarum in Germaniam inuectio laudi datur, tuque
in primis aeuum nostrum tam piis quam elegantibus scriptis

5 illustrasti, tamen vel quod in literis tantus eminebas, ambitiosique
videbatur tam imparem se insinuare in amorem tuum, vel quod
meam tibi amicitiam paruo vsui esse posse tunc videbam, abstinui
tecum hactenus officio literarum, tacitaque veneratione eloquen-
tiam et sapientiam tuam suspexi. Nunc quando sanctissimus

10 D. N. ipse in eum locum a Deo optimo sublatus, me longe imparem
atque immeritum in hoc munus quod multis commodum esse posse
arbitrantur, sua benignitate substulit, coepi id cogitare mecum,
occasionem paulo ampliorem adesse gratificandi tibi, vel si tu
minus nostri indigeres, propter te tuis. Cumque idem S D. N. te

faciat quo muneris sui proprii arbitratur te de sacris literis tam
