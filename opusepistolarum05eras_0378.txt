342 LETTERS OF ERAthis [1523

thirteenth century, which are assigned to the miraculous events, cannot be traced
further back than 1525. The whole circumstances of the present composition
give rise to interesting speculation. Zeller points out that the course of 'Erasmus'
known movements in Italy, 1 506—9, makes it improbable that he should have visited
lioretto. Possibly Bietricius, from whom the impulse certainly came, had made
the pilgrimage from his distant parish and been impressed by what he had seen.
It is noticeable that throughout the Liturqia Erasmus makes no allusion to the
miraculous translation.

Theobald Bietricius was the parish-priest of Porrentruy, a little town 25 miles
sw. of Basle, on the northern slopes of the Jura, which was formerly of some im-
portance as the residence of the Bishop of Basle and one of the centres of his
jurisdiction. The present dedication probably indicates that his acquaintance with
Erasmus had begun in Basle. then Erasmus visited Besancon from Porrentruy
in April 1524 (see Ep. 1440. 411), Bietricius accompanicd him and remained with
him during his stay there. He continued a faithful friend to Erasmus z see his two
letters of 21 July 1524 (Ep. 1468) and 11 Oct. 1526 (Ep. 1760). The latter is the
last trane that I can find of him]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS THEOBALDO BIETRIOIO, PAROCHO
BRVNTRVTENSIS ECOLESIAE, S. D.

I NVNC ct expecta futurum vt Erasmus vel in medio foro saltet,
si tu iubeas. Caeterum quo pauciores probaturi sunt tuum iudicium,
hoc memento te mihi plus debere obsequii nomine. Vnum periculum
video, ne Lauretana diua te canentem Bruntruti non exaudiat.

5 Paulus non damnat hymnos, non damnat psalmum: modo qui
psallit spiritu, psallat et mente. Sed tu in hoc ascitus es, vt prophe-
tam agas, hoc est vt pastorem agas. Si opiliones crederent oues
cantu pinguescere, nihil aliud quam canerent. Nunc, vt vides,
quotidie educunt in pascua, nec domi patiuntur esurire. Non decet

10 pastores ouium plus sapere quam pastores animorum. Educito ac
reducito tu quoque gregem tuum, et inuenies pascua, pabulum et
priuatim et publice suppeditante Euangelio. Noli dicere, Non sum
‹loctor theologiae. Hoc ipsum quod Iesus tradidit, bona cum
fiducia appone populo, et videbis hodie quoque ex paucis panibus

1 5 ac pisciculis paucioribus saturari multa hominum milia. Bene valc.
