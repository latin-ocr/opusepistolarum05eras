1436] TO <GERARD GELDENHAUER?> 427

the same volume contains (f. 216) a copy of another document made by Faesch
‘ in bibliotheca Amerbachiana‚ 28 Aug. 1656, ex autographo Bonis. Amerbachii ‘.

The provenience of the MS. is therefore good3 and on internal grounds there
is no reason why it should not be considered authentic. Its verbal resemblance
to both the compendium Vitae (11. 52—89 ι in vol. i) and Ep. 447 (101-26‚ 147-243,
360—7‚ 420-40) is very close, with the notable difference that the story of Erasmus’
youthful struggles with his guardians is narrated here in the first person instead
of in the third. The coincidence of l. 82 with the lapse in Π. 89 suggests the
possibility that this was the earlier composition, and was cast into the third person
for the compendium Vitae. In any case its existence is a striking confirmation
of the genuineness of that document.

The allusion (ll. 5—6) to Luther's De V otis gives some indication of date ; but there
is nothing to show to whom the letter is addressed. It may be the composition
which Erasmus was asked by Geldenhauer to undertake, but did not venture to
send (Ep. 1437. 212—14). The mention (ll. 116-17) of Ep. 296, which had not yet
appeared in print, offers some confirmation of this conjecture; since it seems
probable that the ‘Franciscus Nouiomagus' to whom that letter was com-
municated by Erasmus (see Ep. 296 introd.)‚ was Geldenhauer, who was both
a Crucifer (see his satyrae, Louvain, Th. Ma-rtens, 13 June 1515) and chaplain to
the Bishop of Utrecht-—Lypsius having made a mistake in the Christian name
(cf. Ep. 1342. 302n). The opponent whom Erasmus answers was evidently on
ἷέθ orthodox side, and may be conjecturally identified with AJard or Paschasius

p- 1437- 29)-

The MS. is inaccurate‚ and needs frequent correction ; and the letter is perhaps
truncated at both ends]

QVI tot tam manifesta mendacia mentiri non veretur, mox
confutandus ex ipsis meis lucubrationibus, quae longe aliud sonant,
quid non audebit confingere ? De veste mutata subinde repetit et
inculcat, non sine multis mendaciis: quorum primum est quod
Lutherus nunquam excusserit cucullam, quum ipse libro ad patrem 5
edito fateatur se deposuisse monachum, cum esset in Patmo;
alterum est quod apostatam vocat quisquis habitum mutarit,
quum apostatae dicantur apud orthodoxos qui defecerunt a pro-
fessione nominis Christiani. Quod si apostatae vocabulum libet
ad monachos detorquere, potius apostatae dicendi sunt qui pecunias 10
congerunt, qui scortantur ac moechantur, qui gulae ventrique
seruiunt, qui episcopis obtrectant, qui praepositos suos non verbis
tantum sed et pugnis et venenis aggrediuntur3 his enim vota
violantur. Nam monachi minima pars est vestis. Haec cum apud
istos sint quotidiana, ob vestem mutatam aut locum desert-um15
apostatae vocabulum ingeminant, quasi hoc ipsum non sit fre-
quentissimum apud istos, vt aliquis abiecta veste profugiat in
militiam aut quo lubet.

Deinde vt demus canonicos regulariter viuentes esse monachos,
vt demus recte apostatam dici qui vestem mutauit, in me certe 20
non quadrat, qui nunquam fuerim monachus. Etenim spontanea
professio monachum facit, non coacta. Et ideo professio ante
pubertatis annos suscepta non habet rigorem, quia tantundem
valet voluntas expers iudicii ct voluntas non libera.
