Erfurt, and after visiting Annaberg and Vienna in the summer of 1526 (cf. ΕΕ.

p. 375) made his way to Italy, where he graduated M.D. at Padua, 1531, and
visited Ferrara (see Manardus‘ Epist. medicinales xiv. 1). He then settled at
Gratz as a practising physician. The last trace of him is in letters of Eobanus
of 23 Dec. <1532> and <14 Sept> 1533 (EHE. 238, 237). He was an intimate friend
of Eobanus (cf. Ep. 1498, and MRE2. 624), who in 1524 mentions him in a verse
translation of Erasmus’ Encomium Medicinae (see BErl.) ; and some of the epigrama
of Eur-icius Cordus (Ep. 941) are addressed to him. See J. Camerarius' Narratio

S. Quid actum sit de literis quas absque titulo misi Duci Georgio,
nondum potui liquido cognoscere. Scribunt Mosellanum e viuis
excessisse, iussisse vt meae ad ipsum epistolae exurerentur. Hic
sunt varii tumultus et rumores atrociores. In amicis quibus profui
ct confisus sum, experior incredibilem et ingratitudinem et per· 5
fidiam. Ego tamen mei similis esse non desinam. Qui te huc
comitatus est, coegit me haec scribere post decimam noct-is.
Iohannes Moldenueldius cupit tibi esse commendatus. Bene vale.

1463. FROM LEVINUS AMMONIUS.

Besaneon MS. 599, p. 98. Bois-St.-Martin.
4 J uly 1524.

[A letter preserved in L. Ammonius' autograph letter-book, in the Public Library
at Besaneon: for knowledge of which Ι am indebted to an article by Professor
Roersch in Bull. soc. hist. dc Gand. 1901. The ms. year-date is eorroborated
by Mich. Bentinus' recent visit to Flanders 3 cf. Ep. 14 3 3. 2n.

Levinus Ammonius (Υ vander Maude: 13 April 1488—19 March 1559) entered
the Carthusian house of Bois-St=.·Martin near Grammont, ΧΨ. of Enghien-where
his brother John (Ep. 570) was an inmate of another Chartreuse-—and made
his profession 18 Aug. 1506. For nearly 27 years he dwelt there, living, though
not always without difficulty (cf. EE. 162), the life of an eager student, interested
especially in Greek: writing mss. of the Gospels 1520, and of the Psalter in
Greek, when in Gueldres in 1540 (Dresden MS. A. 304); proposing, like Rud. Agri-
cola, to copy out Homer from despair of being able to buy a text; inheriting
and cherishing a copy of Herodotus given by Erasmus to Clava (see Ep. 841. 111) 3
working at Chrysostom (cf. 11. 154—5) and translating into Latin the De prouidentia
Dei, Antwerp‚ M. Hillen, <1527?> ; composing a Greek epitaph for Nic. Utenhove
(† 11 Feb. 1527), printed in 1531.

The advent of a new prior, who was a foe to modern studies, disturbed his peace
at Bois-St.-Martin‚ and he was transferred to other houses of his ordor: in 1533 to
Val-Royal or Roygem outside Ghent (see Ant. Sanderus Flandria illustrata i,
1641, 131—3) ; in 1541 to Arnhem ; in 1542 to Scheut near Brussels (see Sanderus,
chorographia sacra Brabantiae ii, 1727, 349-70)‚ where he wrote a life of
Wm. Bibaucius († 14 or 24 July 15 35)-01100 an inmate of Val-Royal, who had been
