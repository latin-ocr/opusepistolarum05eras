Cardinales eruditissimos, qui de rebus Lutheranis respondeant.

Itaque sperant rem breui confectum iri.

Nec dubito quin inter hos sex praecipuus sit Caietanus ; etiamsi

Erasmus tuus.

Pirckheimero‚ Caesareae maiestatis

To CLEMENT VII.

Basle.
13 February 1524.

[An original letter, written and addressed by a secretary, and signed by Erasmus

(ll. 7 3—5) : preserved in the vatican Archives (Lettere di Principi ii. 142).

There

is also an inferior xviic. ms. copy (Arm. 17, vol. 1, f. 33), of which no heed need be
taken. The improvements made in H for ll. 37, 61 perhaps indicate that the
original was composed rapidly: or they may be due to inaccurate copying. The
different position of the significant ll. 67—71 probably shows that in 1110 rough-
draft they were a postscript, ventured upon after reflection.

27. Wonaci] Jo. Romanus Won-
necker (Rullman of Winnecken or
Windecken, N. of Hanau) matriculated
at Erfurt in Oct. 1475. In 1485 he was
a member of the barbers' guild at
Basle, and by 1493, when he matricu-
lated at the University and was ap-
pointed town-physician‚ he had the
degrees of Μ.Α. and M.D. In 1500
110 was made public reader in Medieine,
and in April 1519 and Oct. 1522 was
Rector of the University. On 25 Dee.
1522 110 posted some propositions
which he offered to disputo against
Luther. But his action excitcd only
ridicule (ef. Zw. ΕΩ. 264, 268, 270, 271 ;
000. E„ f. 209); and in 1523 he was
ejected from his madership, with other
professors into whose places oecolam-
padius and Pelliean were substituted
(OPR. p. 81). His propositions afro

preserved in a Carthusian chroniele
(Basler Chronilcen i, 1872, pp. 440-3).
During his first rectorate the two first
students matriculated were Paul and
Luke, each ‘Romanus Wonnecker
Basiliensis’, very likely his 80118. See
W. Viseher, Gesch. Unio. Basel, 1860,
pp. 250-1, 327. Schmidt i, pp. 97.

lished against him c. Jau. 1523.

32. Caietanus] He had been sent off
in haste from Rome 2 July 1523, as
Legata to Hungury, Poland, and
Bohemia, when Adrian VI was sti-ain-
ing every 001νο to prevent those
countries from making peace with the
Turks (Pastor ix. 190, 192). He was
absent from Clement's conclave
(Brewer iii. p. 1477) and was now
still in Hungary (Brown ii. 788, 790).
