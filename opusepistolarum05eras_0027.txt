ADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA :xxi

P. 412, Ep. 1168. 1911. Prof. Preserved Smith points out to me that ''Ornitho-
plutus ab Isocomo’ is one of Erasmus' thin disguises, and denotes Heinrich
ng⁶Epp3ndorff (Hiihnreich von Ebendorf). So also Planodorpius in Ep.

P. 496, Ep. 1205. 1n. For Ep. 1694 read EE2. 32, of 20 April 1528.

P. 547, Ep. 1221 introd. That Peter Tayspil was a brother of Daniel is shown by
a letter to him from Levinus Ammonius (Ep. 1463 introds„ 4 Nov. 1528:
· Me R. in Christo P. ac D. Danieli fratri tuo, qui est a suffragiis Episcopi
Morinensis, quam commendatissimum facias. Is mihi fuit admodum
puero notissimus in scholis, et ante annos, ni fallor, plus minus quinque
et viginti in celebritate sororis vestrae conuiua Cui-traci in monasterio
virginum diuae Catarinae montis Sinai, quando vel ingrediebatur ordinem
illum, nescio, vel profitebatur-¹ <Besancon MS. 599, p. 194).

P. 598, Ep. 1242 introd. For Ep. 1697 read Ep. 1696.
Vox.. V

P. 47, Ep. 1275 introd. For an estimate of Glapion at the time of his appointment
to be Charles' confessor see Brewer iii. 1028.

P. 67, Ep. 1285. 56. Mineruium] Simon Schaidenreisser; of whom apart from
the mentions here and in Ep. 1449, nothing seems to be known before
1532, when he was teaching poetry in a school at Munieh. By 1535 he
had entered the service of the town, and he served it as ⁴ propraetor' 1538-
73. He was a friend of the Munich poet, Marcus Tatius, and himself
published several volumes: an edition of Peter Tritonius' settings to
Horace and other classical poets‚ revised by the Swiss musician, Lud.
Senfl of Zurich, Nuremberg‚ 1534; and translations into German of the
Odyssey and of Cicero’s Ραναάοπα, Augsburg, A. Weissenborn, 1537-8.
Some original letters from him to Jerome Bauingiirtner are in the Public
Library at Dresden (MS. C. 107¹). See ADB. xxx. 552, and H. Thomas in
Proc. osthe Musical Assocc'ation xlvi, 1921, p. 81.

Ep. 1449. 41 shows that Miner-vius was a kinsman of Praus; and as he had
some acquaintance with Erasmus (11. 56-7 and Ep. 1449. 42), it is possible
that he should be identified with Simon of Hexapolis (Ep. 482 ; cf. vol. iv,
p. xxv).

P. 602, Ep. 1526. 35. instigantibus doetisj Prof. Preserved Smith, referring to the
passage quoted in vol. iv, p. xxix in illustration of Ep. 904. 19n‚ points
out to me that Beatus Rhenanus took a leading part in the printing of
Luther’s books at Basle: from the statement of Pellican (CPR. p. 75),
‘ Multi Lutherani libri impressi sunt Basileae, opera et submissione Beati
Rhenani’. 2F⁰r Beatus' eagerness to spread Luther's views see BRE. 83,
113--Zw. E. 53, 79.

Α new direction in which search may be made for MSS. of Erasmus has been
pointed out to me by Dr. J. O. van Slee of Deventer. The Athenaeum
Library there contains a copy of Erasmus' Adayia, Basle‚ Froben, March
1551 (cf. BEr².‚ Αααρία, pp. 134-5) ; 01166 the property of Ant. Perizonius
fl* 24 Oct. 1672), who in 1655 was appointed professor of Hebrew and
predikant at Hamm on the Lippe in westphalia, and in 1661 moved to
Deventer to teach in the Athenaeum School. In this book Perizonius
inserted two autograph papers by Erasmus. containing additions for Adaq.
431, ‘Rana Seriphia '‚ and 1660, ‘Syrbenae chorus '. The latter addition
appeared first in the Froben Aelagu‘a of Feb. 1526, and is marked by Erasmus
480, which is the number of the page of the preceding Froben edition,
Jan. 1523, 011 which it was to be inserted : the former appeared first in the
Froben Adaqia of Sept. 1528, and is marked by Erasmus 164, the page-
number of the edition of Feb. 1526.

At the foot of the latter paper (sor Adaq. 1660) Perizonius reem-ds· that he
received it from ‘D. Henr. Rappous, pastor Hammonensis, qui huiusmodi
cartulas Erasmi manu signatas permultas habebat Hammonae anno 1656,
m. Febr.'. Below the former ho wrote, ‘Accepi hanc schedulam a
reuerendo D. 1011. Henr. Rappaeo, qui mihi 30 Octob. anno 1659 adfuit, ac
dixit hanc esse manum Desid. Erasmi Roterodami δευτέραις φροντίσι
Chiliadas suas emendantis ac locupletantis’.

lt is possible that Rappeus' store of papers may be still in existence.
