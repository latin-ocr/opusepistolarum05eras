Literarisches Museum 1. 143 (ιι). N uremberg.

1 September 1524.

[A letter printed, without indication of editor or source, in part 1 of a periodical,
Literarisches M useum, founded in 1777 at Altdorf, a little town which since 1505
had belonged to its near neighbour Nuremberg, and which from 1623 to 1806
was the seat of a University. The original of the letter cannot now be traced.
For many of the topics raised see Epp. 1452, 1466, which this answers. Erasmus’
reply is not extant, the messenger having failed to deliver it; it may be dated
before 12 Nov. (see Ep. 1536. 211, 311). There are brief acknowledgements of this
letter in Epp. 1536, 1543 ; and Erasmus responds more fully again in Ep. 1 5 58.]

S. Bene est, Erasme praestantissime, quod literas meas omnes
receperis. Quum enini tam peruerse ac fraudulenter in iis consig-
nandis agitur, subdubitabam ne forsan et meae tibi redditae non
fuissent. Sed et 680 tuas accepi binas quam nouissime.

In primis scribis imagines illas fusiles minus feliciter cecidisse ; 5
quod et ego verum esse non ignoro. Ae lieet tribus vsus sim
magistris, nullus tamen desiderio meo satisfecit. Omnes friuolas
quasdam praetendunt excusationes, sed vna illis diligentia deest;
festinant enim et luero inhiant, ac ideo tam infeliciter eis opera

1516—a translation from Ptolemy
about the movements of the planets,
prefixed to vol. iii of the Aldine Ovid.
[n June 1523 the Vitales at Venice
printed for him a considerable volume
of translations from Aristotle's Parua
Naturalia; in Sept. 1524 the Gregorii
some pleasing Dialoqi on philosophical
subjects; on 23 Feb. 1525 Β. Vitalis
some translations of Aristotle and
Proelus. For an edition of Aristotle
and Theophrastus in the Greek,
Florence, Junta, May 1527, he lent
texts which he had corrected. On
20 Jan. 1531 he brought out a miscel-
lany Dc varia historia, Venice, L. A.
Junta, which had been composed many
years before. A Latin version and
commentary on Arist. Dc part. anima-
lium, bk. 1, was edited posthumously by
a nephew, Magnus Leonicus, Venice,
Jo. de Farris, 1540.

He seems to have had special ties
with his English pupils (cf. Brewer iv.
6403) to whom many of his works aro
dedicated: the Parem Nalceralia to

Pace (Ep. 211. 4311) ; the Dialoqc} part
of the Parua Naturalia. and the pos-
thumous volume to Reg. Pole; the
Varia Historia to Tunstall (Ep. 207.
22n); a dialogue, Bonominus, siue de
Alica, to Wm. Latymer (ibid.). Linacre
also was one of them. Pace iu dedicat-
1118 to Tunstall a translation of Plutarch
dc yarrulitate, Venice, Bern. dc Vita-
libus, Jan. 1522, states that the work
was approved by Leonicus, ⁶ noster olim
communis praeceptor, qui quantum tc
glorietur discipulo, haud facile est verbis
exprimere ‘. When Croke went to
Italy in quest of support for Henry‘s
divorce, 1530, he found Leonicus
a stauneh helper (Brewer iv).
