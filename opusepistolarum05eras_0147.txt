De Ciuitate Dei, tit. v0 (a). <Basle.>
Lond. xxviii. 2 ε LB. App. 456. <c. August 1522.)

[A letter contributed to Vives’ edition of Augustine‚ De Ciuitate Dei, Basle,
Froben, Sept. 1522 (α), and printed on the verso of the title z after all the intro-
ductory matter had been received from Vives (ef. Ep. 1303. 3n). An approximate
date ean be assigned.

This volume was intended to form part of a new edition of Augustine, more
complete and correct than that which John Amorbaeh had published in 1506.
Froben had proposed the undertaking to Erasmus in 1517 (Ep. 581. 19), and by
1518 Erasmus had agreed and was at work (Ep. 844. 2 55,6). In Luc. I nd„ 1 Jan.
1519, there is mention of ‘ Censurae in libros Augustini imperfectus liber ’ ; and
public interest was aroused (Ep. 922. 3 5—443 cf. HE. 159). But an opportunity
offered to produce an edition of Cyprian (Epp. 975, 984, 1000), and Augustino was
laid aside. By Sept. 1520 Erasmus had resumed work (Ep. 1144) and for about

Ep. 1350. 1-3) ; though hostile criticism was not lacking (cf. Ep. 1342. 121-2). But
the move from Louvain to Basle in N ov. 1521 threw his plans into some confusion,
and Augustine gave way to a third edition of the New Testament (Ep. 1 174. 15n).

Erasmus' acquaintance with Augustine dated back to his monastic years ι
see vol. i, p. 590 and cf. Ep. 844. 186. At Paris in 1500 a manuscript of the Enchiri-
dion was one 01 his cherished possessions (Epp. 123. 21, 135. 44, 138. 120). He had
read widely, too, in the old theology‚ and especially in Augustine (Ep. 844. 166-88 ;
cf. Ep. 1304. 153—77). But even his powers 01 work were unequal to the task of
editing the whole of Augustine anew. He proposed to divide it, as J erome had been
divided, among a number of hands ς and in the autumn of 1520 Vives was persuaded
to undertake the De Ciuitate Dei.

B. Dombart, Zur Textqesch. der Ciuitas Dei, 1908, pp. 43—5, shows that this
is the first of the many early—printed editions to give any definite indication of
the manuscripts used. At Vives’ disposal were three: one procured by Erasmus
from Cologne, and said to be by the hand of St. Ludger († 809)—perhaps the viiie

codd. mss„ 1874 3 a second lent by Marcus Laurinus from St. Donatian’s at Bruges—
these two Vives was allowed to have at Louvain ς and a third shown to him by the
Carmelites at Bruges in the summer of 1521 (Aug. f0. aa⁴ and p. 445). By 1 Jan.
1521 he set to work, and by the end of the month had completed the first book
(Aug. 10. aa4). In spite oi ill-health six books were ready by July (Ep. 1222);
but it was not till Jan. 1522 that the first seven were actually dispatched to Basle
(Ep. 1256). The next ten followed in April (Ep. 1271) ; and 111 July the last five
arrived with prefaces and introduction (Ep. 1303). Erasmus composed this letter
to the reader, to fill the verso of the title-page. Froben was at work in July
(see Ep. 1293 introd.), and no doubt earlier ; and by September the book was out.

Into the subsequent history 01 1110 Froben Augustine, which appeared in 1528-9
111 1011 volumes, we need not now enter. One point, however, must be noticed.
The De Ciuitate Dei is included there as vol. v, Dec. 1529, being the last volume
to be printed ; but apart from the mention of Vives on the title-page, with an added
statement that Erasmus had improved the text from a manuscript—procured from
Peter Gilles (see Erasmus’ letter to Sehets, 2 Oct. 1526), and apparently still in
Erasmus’ possession at hjs death (Basle MS. C. vla. 71, f. 48 ι printed by C. Mia-
skowski, Korresp. des Erasmus mit Pelen, 1901, p. 47)—the book is a plain text.
This letter, Vives’ prefaces and introduction and notes had all disappeared 3
and thus this letter is not found in any other contemporary edition.

This suppression was no doubt connected in part with the fact that the De
Ciuitate Dei· had not sold well (Ep. 1531 and Lond. xx. 87, viv. 19: LB. 975, 990);
and thus on 15 Oet. 1527—3. date which is probably prior to Froben’s death—
Erasmus reported to Vives that the printers proposed to omit this treatise altogether
from the new Augustino (Lond. xx. 20, Lss. 901). Rcfleetion must have shown them,
however, that in a collected edition this was impossib103 and they repaired tho
