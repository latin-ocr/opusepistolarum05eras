TO HAIO HERMANN 515

vestium nominibus certo queat pronunciare, quum me viuo toties
mutatas videam vestimentorum formas.
Criticos istos de quibus scribis, rideo: qui si vicissim aederent

sua, inuenirent fortassis et ipsi censores suos.

animo patior mihi laudem detrahi, qui mihi nihil laudis arrogo.
Alicubi, sicut opinor, scripsi Budaeum cum Hermolais et Politianis
certamen sustinere, et fortasse ἐν τῷγε γράφειν Ἑλληνιστὶ primas illi
tribui. Nec adhuc video quenquam qui tantum etiam possit ex
tempore. Nam frequenter ad me scribit quauis de re totas Graecas 2 5
aut semigraecas epistolas, idque ex tempore. Caeterum, quum essem
in Italia, doctos omnes veneratus sum, nec quisquam a me contem-
ptus est. Angeli Colicii nomen ne audiui quidem vnquam; vnde

miror quod ille repererit inuectiuae argumentum.
ingeniis semper candidissime et sensi et praedicaui.

pretationem quam in me desiderat 1 De mali corui malo ouo refero

17. toties mutatas] Cf. the colloquy
Franciecani, first printed in the Froben
edition of March 1524 (LB. i. 743 r):
‘ Nonne videmus et hodie quasdam anus
tenentes sui seculi cultum, qui magis
est diuersus a cultu horum temporum
quam meus cultus abest a tuo ‘2 ⁷

19. criticos istos] This band, whom
Erasmus describes elsewhere as ‘ pa-
gani’ (Ep. 1489. 20-21 ; cf. Epp.
1488. 10-11, 1496. 183—4) is clearly the
Roman Academy (of. Ep. 1342. 326n).
For details about its members see
Pastor viii, ch. 5 and Gregorovius,
Rome in the Middle Aqes, bk. xiv,
ch. 4 ; citing Sad. Ε. 106.

22. Alicubi] See Ep. 531. 39—49.

28. Colicii] Cf. Ep. 1482. 29. No
doubt Ang. Colocci (1467—-1 May 1549)
is intended. He was a native of Jesi‚
near Ancona, and was educated at
Rome under Geo. Valla (l.' 70n), and
afterwards at Naples. On the death
of his wife he entered the Church, and
in Jan. 1506 was one of the papal
secretaries (cf. vol. iii, p. xxx). Later
he became the leader of the Roman
Academy. In Nov. 1521 he was
‘bpffissllffdaffiafflssssssgassss' ἐξ 1ῗὲοὲΞῖ 1ἰί
May 1537; but he resigned in 1545
111 order to be free for his literary pur-
suits. He had a garden in Rome-—
on the site of the present Palazzo del
Bufalo, near the Piazza 0010111111»-
which he enrichcd with collections of
art and antiquity (cf. Ja. Mazochius'
Epiqrammata antiquae Vrbis, Rome,
April 1521, ff. 97 v0.—100); but these
suffered severely in the Sack of 1527.
An edition of the Scholia on Homer was
printed in his house c. Sept. 1517
(legi-and i. 56). Some of his books
and papers wore acquirod by Fulvio

Orsini (1529-1600), and are now in the
Vatican: a few Greek and many
Latin MSS„ and also some in Pro-
vencal. There is abundant detail about
them in La Bibliotkeque de Fulvio
Orsini, by P. de Nolhac, 1887; who
desiderates a monograph on Colocci.
He published very little, and even the
‘ inuectiua ² of l. 29 was probably only
eirculated in ms.

There is a life by Fed. Ubaldinus‚
Rome, 1673, and a collection os his
poems by J. F. Lancellotti‚ Jesi, 1772.
See also Tiraboschi vii. 13 59-61 ;
AE; Gams3 Pastor viii. 1893 and
Gregorovius op. cit. Jo. Pierius
Valerianus (1477-15 58) makes Colocci
0110 of the principal speakers in his
dialogue De litteratorum infelicitate,
1620.

29. Italorum] For complimentary
words of Erasmus about Italy see
Epp. 531. 44-9, 635. 6-8, 809. 124-5.

30. Casalium] Jo. Baptista Casalius,
canon oi the Lateran and member of
the Roman Academy ; verses by whom
appear in the Corycium, f0. 1⁴¹² ΥΟ. (see
Ep. 1342. 326n). He was sn admirer
of Longolius, and edited the Defensio,
Rome, S. Guilleret, 9 Aug. 1519 (cf. Lo.
F.. ff. 95 v⁰., 147 v0.) with which
Longolius replied to the opposition over
his citizenship of Rome; and also
addressed to Clement vn an oration
I η lcyem amariam pro communi zwilftate.
et ecclesiastica libertam tuenda, Rome,
1524. By Aug. 1525 he was dead
(Epp. 1597. 1603). See P. de Nolhac.
