1481] To JOHN MATTHEW GIBERTI 527
fuit inter Achillem et Hectorem ; inter quos pariter feroces ira fuit
capitalis, quemadmodum ait Flaccus, vt vltima diuideret mors.

Scripsit ad me Nicolaus Maruillanus, Clementis animum nescio
quibus de causis alieniorem factum ab Academia Louaniensi, 45
proinde reiicere preces ambientium confirmationem veterum
priuilegiorum. Primum hic illud velim praefari, vir clarissime,
hac in causa mihi nec meti nec seri: tamen qui huc instigant
Pontificem, fortassis seruientes priuatis affectibus, mea sententia
non optime consulunt illi. Satis odii conflatum est Pontificio 50
nomini, etiamsi nihil accedat. Nihil autem odiosius quam reuocare
quod maiorum benignitas indulsit, quae potius dilatari consueuit.
Et decet Clementem suo nomini respondere. Adde quod haec
Academia est Vnicum ornamentum Caesareae apud nos ditionis, sic
florens omni genere studiorum vt non cedat Parisiensi. Nec vlla 55
minus infecta est Lutherano negocio.

Nec enim illi debet imputari, quod Nicolaus Ecmondanus causam
Pontificiam infeliciter gessit. Quid enim aliud faceret homo
natura fatuus, nec admodum doctus, moribus inamoenis, prae-
fracti animi, impotenti impetu, nec alio spectans quam ad suum 60
commodum. Itaque quod euenit, futurum praedixeram Alcandro :

43. Flaccus] S. 1. 7. 13.

44. Mamillanus] Nic Varius (†2 Oct.
1529) of Marville, 20 ms. N. of Verdun,
in one of the districts of Luxemburg
specified in Busleiden's will (Neve
p. 381), took his degree in philosophy
from the College du Faucon in 1511.
In 1526 he succeeded John Fortis
(Ep. 1322), and thus became second
President of the Collegium trilingue.
One of the first episodes of his brief
tenure of that office was to act in
a dispute that arose over Rescius' posi-
tion in the Collegc (Ep. 1768). In
Aug 1527 Erasmus dedicated to him
a translation from Chrysostom. See
Val. Andreas p. 277, and Neve. His
letter mentioned here does not sur-
vive: Erasmus' first extant letter to
him is in 1526.

47. priuilegiorum] The question of
the maintenance of the professors and
of nominations to the benefices appor-
tioned to them had been prominent.
since the earliest days of the Univcrsity.
A bull oi Eugenc lv, 23 May 1443, ineor·
porating certain parish churches in the
chapter of St. Peter-’s for the support
of new prebends and making other
provision, cncountercd stron opposi-
tion from the Bp. of Licge at t at time ς
who considered his rights in the matter
infringed. Tho dispute continued at
intervals3 and a privilege granted
by Leo x to tho Faculty of Arts

(Al. Ε. ij. 142) was again resisted by
Erard de la Marck. Adrian VI con-
firmed this privilege, 16 June 1523:
and the bulls, which had been delayed.
were dispatched by Clement vn,
26 Nov. 1523. In these, consideration
was shown for Erard’s protests3 but
the University stood firm, and was on
the point of carrying the day, had not
Aleander, as Erarcl’s representative,
ifiloewened at Rome in April 1524 (Al.
⁴. ii. 119).

It appears that the present applica-
tion gained some further concessions
for the University; see Ep. 1509, and
a letter of Giberti to the Rcctor,
15 March 1525, acknowledging a letter
of thanks. Cf. also Ep. 1716 init.

For this notc I am again indebted to
the work of the late Prof. dc Jongln
see lus pp. 43, 255-7, 49*.

5 5. non cedat Parisiensi] A stronger
statement than thatin Ep. 1221. 10-—1 1.

57. Ecmondanus] In view of the
many topics raised here, De Jongh's
opinion (sco his p. 257) that ‘le but
principal‘ of this letter was ‘obt-enix-
la protection du pape contre les
attaqucs d’Egmondanus ' seems exag-
geratcd. The matter was important
to Erasmus; and ho hints at it in
writing again a mouth later (Ep. 1506.
(un). But Rome did not decide to

at Cologne in Nor. 1520 ; see Ep. ¹155
inti-od. Ep. 1482. 8-10 shows that
