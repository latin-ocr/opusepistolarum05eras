1413] FROM PHILIBERT OF LUCINGES 389

Erasmum belle prospereque valere. Nescio an illis responderit3
non licuit enim amphus quam triduum apud eum commorari. 40
Exinde non vidi hominem; igitur ignoro an conualuerit necne.
Gratulor P. d. t. quod tantam de me mentionem fecerit apud
eundem Abbatem ; non quod me dignum iudicem tanti viri com-
mendatione, qualis est Erasmus, Verum illa est et fuit perpetua
Erasmi claementia et benignitas. Vnde, Erasme‚ non sunt aequales 45
vires meae in nullis naec in punct-ulo quidem gratulari tuis in me
beneficiis. Tu tamen animum pro factis reputabis, velimque tibi
persuadeas naeminem in amando Erasmum ardentiorem Philiberto :
quem, si lubuerit, in tuorum albo inscribes. Is non renuet in
omnibus tibi praesto esse. Bene vale, litteratorum decus eximium. 50
Datum Gebenne, xiii Kl. februarias. M D xxiiii.

[The preface to Erasmus’ Paraphrase 011 the Acts, Basle, Froben, 1524, folio (α) ;
printed simultaneously by Froben in octavo without change in this preface‚ each
issue numbering 3‚000 copies (Ep. 1423. 54—5). The printing was nearly com-
pleted by 8 Feb. ; but as a messenger offered, Erasmus took the opportunity to
send off a copy of the preface in advance (Epp. 1416. 34, 1423. 15). On 17 Feb.
the book was still unfinished (VE. 380) ; but a few days later it was possible to
dispatch a copy of the octavo to Rome with the greatest speed then available
(Epp. 1418, 1422, 142 3, 1442). Clement received it with favour (Ep. 1438) and at
01166 sent Erasmus a handsome present of money (Epp. 1466. 3—7, 1467. 1 3-1 5, 1486.
9—11, 1488. 15—16: cf. 1, p. 43. 9-14 and Lond. xxi. 52, LB. 854 of 24 March 1527.
Two more octavo editions by Froben in 1524 are known; one with a title-page in
roman (Library of St. Mary's, Spalding), the other, ‘ex secunda Erasmi recogni-
110111131 ’, 4 J fuly 1 524 (Library of St. lValburga's, Zutphen). Neither has any change
in t· ‘s re ace.

By &April 1525 all the original issues were sold out (Basle MS. C. VIa. 73. 233) ἶ
but Froben did not print this Paraphrase again until it was included in the collected
editions of 1534 and onwards. There it appears without this prefacc; which

considera-tion ; and there is nothing to show that Erasmus' feelings towards him
changed materially at the end. An explanation may perhaps be found in the rela-
tions between Pope and Emperor after 1527: Erasmus’ obligations to Charles
making suppression desirable. Or it may simply have been that on 25 Sept. 1 5 34
Clement had died. In any case there certainly was no scandal such as necessit-ated
the removal of Ep. 956.

Besides the printed editions of 1524 there is 6 ms. copy (Β) at San Daniele,
in Fontaninus' vol. xiii (MS. 219, p. 842: see p. 394), badly written and very
inaccurate. There is nothing to be gained by reproducing its blunders ; and of
its variants the only one of importance is the signature. The presence of this
indicates that the copy was not made from any of the printed texts but from
6 MS.. very likely the copy sent by Erasmus to Rome through Filonardi with
Ep. 1416: 6 supposition which would explain its survival among other papers
