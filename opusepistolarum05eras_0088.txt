58 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1522

1280. To MARTIN DAVIDTS.
Opus Epistolarum p. 835. ⁵ (Baslc.)
N. p. 798 : Lond. xxi. 36: LB. 1002. <6. May 1522 ⁴2>

[The date of this letter is not easy to determine. Philip Haneton, seigneur 01
Linth, secretary to the Grand Council 1494, first secretary 01 audience 1517,
treasurer of the Golden Fleece 1520, is said to have died on 18 April 1521 ‘ avant
Pasques ’, i. e. 1522, when Eastcr fell on 20 April : see the inscription on his tomb
in St. Gudule’s‚ Brussels, quoted by A. Sanderus, Grand Theatra εαενέ de Brabant,

1734, i, p. 199. The same year is given by de Reiffenberg, who states (p. 356)
that the treasurership of the Golden Fleece, vacant by his death, was filled up on
‘ Paques Fleuries ’ <13 April> 1522 z and this is further corroborated by Haneton’s
complete disappearance from the pagos of Brewcr after 20 March 1522 (iii. 2119),
although previously he had been mentioned frequently. So 1522 may be accepted.
The discrepancy of mouth-date is slight and can be reconciled without difficulty.

Thus Erasmus had left Louvain before Haneton’s death. In consequence the
dates 01 time and place given in the Opus Epistolarum (H) must both be wrong ;
and the correction made in N carries no conviction. In any case the letter must be
prior to the publication of H in Sept. 1529 ; and from the fact that, in adding dates
then, Erasmus considered it to belong to the Louvain period, it may be inferred
that he had written both letter and epitaph some years before. But a difficulty
is presented by ΕΕ. 163, a letter from Davidts, written 19 Nov. 1531, which
instances as a specimen of Erasmus' kindness, ‘ nam recepi epitafium quondam
domini et magistri Philippi Haneton, de quo non memini me gratias egisse,
sicque gratias ago '. This suggests that the epitaph must have been sent to him
fairly, though not quite, recently ; but as it was printed in H, at least two years
must have elapsed since it reached him. That interval is in itself so considerable
as to suggest that Davidts may have been referring, not to the original epitaph,
but to a copy sent at a later date. Or if he could stay two years to send his thanks,
he may well have stayed much longer. In view therefore of Erasmus' own impres-
sion that this letter was written at Louvain, it may be placed at no great distance
in time from Haneton’s death]

QVANQVAM aliis intentus, tamen hoc opellae non grauate dedi,

grauabor recudere. Bene vale [Louanii, Anno M.D.XV1H].
PhiJippus Haneton, clarus auro hic est eques.
Regi Philippo Caesarique Carolo
Cum laude gessit audientiarium.

Voluit eundem praeesse thesauris suis.
Virtus in vno hoe vicit inuidiam viro ;
Tanta erat in omnes et fides et comitas
Animique candor, maximis et infimis
1< Desideratus vnice‚ coelum tenet.
