1404] To MARGARET ROPER 367

quique studiorum vestrorum verus erit Apollo, cuius laudes pro 15
fesceninis tuis infantulis lyrae poteris occinere. Solus enim hio
dignus est qui fidibus, qui fistulis, qui voce, qui musices omni
genere, sed praecipue modulatis piae mentis affectibus iugiter
celebretur.

Non dedignabitur a talibus coniugibus decantari, quorum ea est 20
vitae totius puritas, concordia, tranquillitas, simplicitas, vt aegre
reperias virginitatis professores qui se ausint comparare. Rarum
exemplum hoc praesertim seculo, sed quod video breui ad plures
permanaturum. Habetis isthic Reginam velut istius sanctissimi
chori Calliopen. Sunt et in Germania familiae non obscurae, quae 25
neutiquam infeliciter meditantur quod vos hactenus felicissime
praestatis. Bene vale, non infimum aeui Britanniaeque tuae decus,
et totum istum chorum mihi saluta diligenter.

1405. FROM 01Ηο BRUNFELS.

Brunfelsii Responsio, f0. e³ v0. <strasburg ¹2>
(c. December 1 523>

[The preface to Brunfels’ Pro Vlr'icho H utteno defuncto, ad Erasmi Roter. Spon-
qiam Responsio, strasburg, J. Schott, 3.(1. (α), of which a revised edition (β)
followed very shortly (HE. pp. 82*, 8 3*)‚ each being affixed to a corrected edition
of Hutten’s Expostulatio (see Ep. 1356. 63n). The Responsio answers ‘the second
edition of the Spongia (Ep. 1389); and its publication may be placed between
19 Jan.‚ when Erasmus was expecting its appearance (Ep. 1411), and 13 March
1524 (Ep. 1429? cs. Ep. 1437. 30-1‚ Horawitz v. 72, and Herminjard 103). By
21 July the second edition (β) was in circulation (Ep. 1466. 25—6; cf. Ep. 1477).
In view of these dates, this letter and Ep. 1406, which are printed in both editions,
may be placed about the end of 1523 ; and this is corroborated by the sequence
of events narrated in Ep. 1406, where Brunfels describes his long hesitation 10
take up his pen.

I cannot trace certainly where he was at this time ; but Ep. 1406. 14 seems 10
imply that he had left Neuenburg, and, as the book was printed at Strasburg,
his settlement there had perhaps begun.

Otho Brunfels or Brunnfels of Mainz (c. 1488—23 Nov. 1534) was the son of
a cooper who traced his origin to Braunfels near the Lahn, in the domains of the
Counts of Solms. After taking an M.A. at Mam, in pursuit of leisure he entered
the Carthusian house outside the walls of Strasburg. Before long he was dis-
illusioned; finding that, though allowed considerable freedom in correspondente,
he was debarred from effective contact with reform. His first publications were
educationaL printed by Schott at Strasburg3 Dc coo-riqendz's studiis sevcrioribus,
1519, and Aplcorismi institutionis puerorwn, 30 Aug. 1519, with extracts adapted
from Rud. Agricola, and Erasmus' Dc rationo studii, and a preface 10 1113 ProvinciaL
Greg. Reisch of Freiburg (Ep. 308), expressing admiration for Erasmus. In Jan.
1520 he introduced himself to Beatus Rhenanus, and c. 17 May 1520 to Erasmus
(BRE. 145, 176) ; and his letters of this period to Beatus show him furtively using
the manuscript treasures of his monastery for the benefit of the humanist printers.
In May 1520 L. Schurer at Schlettstadt printed for him a Consutatio sophistices ;
which attacks Erasmus’ opponente, Dorp and Luther. By 1521 he had determined
to seek release, and on 10 June wrote to Spiegel asking for the help of Aleander
