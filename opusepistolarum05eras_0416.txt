380 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1524
sophum egregium, mathematicum, Graecum, pulchre Latinum.
Quem cum nuper ex Italia per Heluetiam in Gallias sese reciperet,
an eompellaueris neseio, Cum quo si verba feceris, non neeesse est
quod de eo pluribus agam.

si fortassis relato tot virorum insignium catalogo quod petieramus
depreceris, id oneris in primuni quemque lelegaturus, eodem quo
antea fulciemur clypeo ; hoc est, phrasim tuam non nisi ardentissime
anhelamus et miram quandam in scribendo dexteritatem dictio-
nemque Latinam, quam mortalium nullus aequet, nedum vineat.
Quid super hac re deereueris, nisi molestum fuerit, paucis nos
certiore-s facere non grauabere. Atque eo libentius feceris, si tibi
persuasum fuerit nos epistolam penu tuo profectam preciosius
adseruaturos quam Macedonum ille princeps quondam scriniolo
illo tam diuiti tamque opulento adseruarit Homerica. Glareanum,
virum festinissimum, doctissimum prudentissimumque, nomine meo
salutabis

Meldis, apud Fabrum in familia domini Episcopi Meldensis.

118. Meldensis] Wm. Brieonnet(1471
—25 Jan. 1534), son of Charles vm's
finanee minister, who had taken orders
when a widower and died in 1514 as
Abp. of Narbonne and Cardinal. The
son after studying Arts at Paris in the
College of Navarre 1486—7. was ap-
pointed Bp. of Lodeve 111 1489, Abbot
of St. Germain-des-Pres at Pan's 111
1505, and Bp. of Meaux in 1516. In
1507 110 was at Rome on a mission to
Julius 11; in 1511 110 aecompanied his
father to the Couneil of Pisa; from
1516 to 1518 Francis 1 employed him
in Rome. He was enthusiastic for
learning and moderate reform, and
attached great importanee to the
translation of the Bible into Freneh.
For this purpose he settled Faber
Sta ulensis (Ep. 315) and other seholars
at t. Germanus, and after 1520 took
them to Meaux. But finding him-

self unable to restrain their inno-
vating activity, he was obliged to
dismjss first Farel (l. 92n)‚ and theu
Faber and Roussel (l. 92n) in 1525.
The Franciscans of Meaux instituted
a suit against him before the Parlia·
ment of Paris, 1525—6; and in the
absence of Francis 1 and Margaret of
Valois, who had given him consistent
support, he lacked resolution to face
the charge of heresy, and made his
submission.

Erasmus had met him in earlier
years, while he was Bp. of Lodeve‚
and spoke a word on his behalf at the
time of his trial (Ep. 1581).

Herzog; and G. V. Jourdan, Catholic
Reform in the early ,1η century, 1914.

Beatus Rhenanus, In C. Plinium,
Basle, Froben, March 1526, p. 87, states
that the Bp. kept a tame erane in his
house at Paris.
