τὴν τῶν σοι ἀπηχθημενων σύστασιν καταβαρεΐν· ἄλλως τε ἐπειδὴ 60
οὐκ ὀλίγοις τῶν συνετῶν καὶ χρηστῶν ’ἔδοξαν οὗτοι οὐδὲν ὑγιὲς
φρονεῖν, καὶ βασκαίνειν μᾶλλον τοῖς φιλοκαλοῦσι τῶν σοφῶν, τῆς
καλλίστης τε καὶ ἀξιεπαίνου καινοτομίας, ἦ ζῆλόν τινα χρηστὸν
και ἐπιεικῆ διώκειν.

Τούτων οὖν οὕτως ἐχόντων θαυμάζω σου πρότερον μὲν μετανί-
στασθαι προθυμουμει ου τε και ἀφορμῆς δεομένου, νῦν δὲ ἀφορμὴν
λαμπροτάτην εὑρημενου, εἶτα δὲ διαμέλλοντος. Σὺ οὐν ἤδη
διάγνωθι περι τῆς προκλήσεως, πότερον ἀποδεχεσθαι ταύτην j)
διακρούεσθαί σοι βελτιον· μεταγνοίη γὰρ ἂν ὁ Βασιλεύς, ἣν7
αἴσθηται ἐντρυφώμενος.

A [The person addressed evidently was expected to have inssuence with the
bbot of Wettingen (l. Sn), and was unknown to Erasmus (l. 3). I owe to Dr.
R. Wackernagel and to Herr F. Heusler of Basle, the suggestion, made indepen-
dently, that he may very probably be identified with the Abbot of Liitzel or Lucelle‚
the principal Cistercian house in Upper Germany, which lies on the present frontier
between Switzerland and Alsace‚ about 16 ms. sw. of Basle. Liitzel was founded
in 1 12 3, and was the parent house of Salmanschwyl near Ueberlingen, from which
Wettingen in its turn was founded ι so that the one Abbot might suitably be in-
voked to intervene with the other. Moreover, as there was a Liitzelhof in Basle‚
the Abbot no doubt came there at intervals, and may thus have had opportunity
to know the parish priest of Riehen.

The Abbot of Liitzel at this period was ssheobald Hyllweg of Thann († 20 April
