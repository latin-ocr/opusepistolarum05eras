LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1523

15 nostra ad nostrum (futhebertum Londinensem Episcopum, cui
nuper duas sacrorum adagiorum centurias dedicaui.

Scripsi item,

postquam hinc proxime discessisti, ad te literas, casque nostro
Moro dedi3 sed quia nihil responsum est, postea mihi eatenus
tacendum putaui, quoad vsu veniret vt vspiam vna essemus;

20 quod. tandem aliquando fiet.

Interim si tibi vsui esse possum,

Vtere Polydoro tuo, qui te etiam pecunia iuuare cupit; cuius rei
cum posthac periculum secerni, spes non fallet, vti de puero tuo

scire poteris.

Vale Londini. 111. Nonas Iunias. Mnxxm.

Saluta, quaeso, meis verbis Ioh. Occolampadium, si istic agat,

et nostrum Beatum Rhenanum.

Reuerendo domino Erasmo, amico charissimo.

FROM CUTHBERT TUNs'rALL.

London.
5 June 1523.

[The year-date is confirmed by the mention of Luther's book against Henry vm

(1- 3)-

The change in the mouth-date in N is no doubt a mere depravation.]

OVTBERTVS TONSTALLVS, LONDINENSIS ECCLESIAE MINISTER,
ERASMO ROTERODAMO S. D.

D101 non potest quantopere sum gauisus lectis tuis literis, prae-
sertim his quibus tum ad Regem, tum ad Legatum scriptis, his te
suspitionibus liberas, quas de libello a Luthero in Regem edito,

 

‘ At nemo mehercle homo magnificen-
tius id officii suis praestitit quam noster
Des. Erasmus Roterodamus ; cui post-
quam nonnullas suo excellenti ingenio
auxerat artes, nihil potius fuit quam
suam Germaniam, minus olim literarum
peritam, longe doctissimam efficere : in
qua sane re tantum profecit vt nusquam
gentium hodie hominum ingenia magis
eruditione floreant ⁷. Cf. Ep. 1406. 211-
12.

1366. 15. Cuthebertum] Tunstall,
who had been consecrated Bp. of
London 9 Oct. 1522, in succession to
Fitzjames (see Ep. 1211. 365n). The
letter mentioned here was probably
designed as a preface for an addition
to Polydore's Adaqia sacra, which, to
the number of 431, had already been
printed, with a dedication to Pace,
5 June 1519, in Froben’s edition of
July 1521 (cf. Ep. 1175. 4, 117nn).
I cannot find that the 200 were ever
added, or the preface printed: it is
not in the second Froben edition, June
1525. But from the definiteness of
Polydore‘s statement it may be inferred
that the ‘ accession ' (cf. Ep. 1494. 29)

was sent to Tunstall in ms. ; and the
preface to him, in which Erasmus is
extolled (cf. l. 13n)‚ was perhaps con-
verted into an Apoloqia to the reader—
dated from London, 29 April 1524, and
appended to the Froben volume of
June 1525, f0. b³—in which Polydoro
defends himself for having introduced
some Christian adages into the edition
Of 11ξέ proxime discessisti] In April 1 517:
see p. 577.

literas] Not extant. It was perhaps
written in the summer of 1520 to in-
vite Erasmus to recommend Polydore’s
Adaqu'a to Froben : cf. Ep. 1175. 1 15n.

25. si istic agat] For the uncertainty
of Oecolampadius' movements since his
arrival at Basle (Ep. 1335. 65n) cf. Ep.
1401. 22n.

1367. 1. literis] Not extant. They
were probably written about the end
of April (cf. l. 103n) and carried by
Levinus AlgoetOEp. 1373. 1). For men-
tion of the answers see Ep. 1383.
2 n.

72. Legatum] Wolsey.
3. libello] See Ep. 1308. 9n.
