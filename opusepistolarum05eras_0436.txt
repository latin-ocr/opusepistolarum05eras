400 LETTERS or ERASMUS [1524

(Epp. 1385,6) 3 to chry vm and to the Pope‚ both oi whom had long been urging
him to take this step (cf. Epp. 1408. 21—3, 1411. 23—4 ἶ1415. 54-5, 1416. 24). The
subiect that he selected on which to engage his now formidable antagonist was
one on which they Ι111101·οᾰ fundamentally. Luther had seen this divergenee from
the first (LE2. 34. 34—6) ; and Epp. 1342. 932-5‚ 1384. 9—12, show that no com-
promise was possible. Erasmus’ choice of it was perhaps suggested to him by
Tunstall’s words in Ep. 1367. 15-19. When the first drait mentioned here was
completed‚ he sent it to England for Henry to see (Ep. 1430). In May, in response
to Luther's solemn warning against attack, he endeavoured to conceal how far
he had gone (Ep. 1445. 16) ; to Oecolampadius in conversation he described it as
⁴ opus tn‘dui . . .‚ idque fellis expers ' (LE2. 795. 27-8). But later, finding that
rumour was rife (cf. Epp. 1466. 58-9‚ 1470. 46-7), he deeidad, perhaps with reluc-
tanco, to publish (cf. Epp. 148 1, 810). As the composition of the first draft occupied
only five days, this note may be placed close to Ep. 1418. 54.

The De libero arbitrio has been reprinted in 1910 by Prof. J. Walter ; who after
careful collation of the three editions published in Sept. 1524—by Froben at
Basle, by Hillen at Antwerp, and by Cervicornus at Cologne———concludes that
Froben's is the original, Epp. 1385. 11-13, 1430. 16-18 notwithstanding. The Ger-
man antiquary‚ Theoph. Spizelius (16 39-91 ), states in his record of the Mss. existing
in the various libraries of Europe, Sacra bibliothecarum illustrium arcana retecta, Augs-
burg, 1668, p. 30, that a MS. of it <very likely original> was on the list fumished to
him from Basle by J o. Buxtorf in 1661 ; but it seems to have passed out of the
Library, perhaps like other of its MSS„ by exchange (cf. Ep. 479 introd.).

For detailed study of Erasmus' attitude towards Luther and of the abundant
literature about this controversy see A. Freitag in the Weimar edition oi Luther’s
Werke, xviii, 1908, pp. 5 51—97 x also an Etude critique by the late Andre Meyer,
1909, pp. 98-111.]

S. Amice incomparabilis, mitto ad te primam manum nugamenti
De libero arbitrio. Hic perdidi dies quinque, non sine magno tedio,
Sciebam me non versari in mea harena. Rogo dignere inspicere,
et indicare vbi a toto scopo aberrarim. Nolim tamen hoc ad alios
ς permanare. Bene vale.
D. Preposito.

1420. FROM Lours BER.
Basle MS„ 1.-6. <Basle.>
(c. February 1524.)

[An original letter, autograph throughout: bound up in a volume entitled
⁸ Variorum Epistolae ad Erasmum ’, in the Basle University Library. A precise
date is not possible3 but it seems clear that this was written in comment on
a point in Erasmus' De libero arbitrio. The first draft of this was submitted to
Ber (Ep. 1419) ; who, as an expert theologian (cf. Ep. 413. 1111), was competent
to debate any questions arising, in the technical language of the schools. In
publishing the De libero arbitrio Erasmus finally disposed of the matter as follows :
² Sed dixerit aliquis, Interim duplici nomine necessitas est in rerum euentis, quod
nec praescientia Dei falli possit nec voluntas impediri. Non omnis necessitas ex·
cludit liberam voluntatem, quemadmodum Deus Pater necessario gignit Filium,
et tamen volens ac libere gignit, quia non coactus. Potest et in humanis rebus
aliqua poni necessitas, quae tamen non excludat libertatem nostrae voluntatis.
Praesciebat Deus, et quod praesciebat aliquo modo volebat, fore vt Iudas proderet
Dominum. Itaque si spectes Dei praescientiam infallibilem et voluntatem im-
mutabilem, necessario euenturum est vt Iudas prodat Dominum ; et tamen Iudas
poterat mutare voluntatem suam, aut certe poterat non suscipere voluntatem
impiam. Dices, Quid si mutasset? Non fuisset falsa Dei praescientia, nec im-
pedita voluntas, quum hoc ipsum praesciturus fuerit ac voliturus, quod esset
mutaturus voluntatem.

In his, qui rem scholastica subtilitate discutiunt, recipiunt necessitatem conse-
quentiae, consequentis necessitatem reiiciunt. Nam his verbis solent explicare
quod sentiunt. Fatentur enim necessario consequi quod Iudas proditurus fuerit
Dominum, si hoc ab aeterno voluntate efficaci voluit Deus: at negant consequi
quod ideo necessario proditurus sit, quum ex sua praua voluntate susceperit
impium negocium.
