1301. ΤΟ THE THEOLOGIANS or LOUVAIN.

Vita Erasini p. 105. <Basle.>
02. p. 241 : Lond. xxx. 57 ε LB. 1206. (c. 14 -July 1522.)

[This letter is known in two forms ε one, which is the shorter, first published by
Merula, probably from a rough-draft, since it has no dates; the other, which is
considerably longer, printed with the first edition of the Cataloqus Lucubrationmn
(1), Basle, Froben, April 1 52 3, 1⁰. {³ (α). The shorter is evidently the earlier, as it
was written in haste on receipt of the news of proposed action against Erasmus at
Louvain ; and it doubtless represents a letter actually sent with Epp. 1299, 1300,
which it resembles closely. The longer was written after the arrival of ampler
reports, and was perhaps never sent to Louvain ; Erasmus being content to print
it when opportunity offered, as his considered defence of the points attacked.
Merula’s note—that the letter, as he had it, ‘ accompanied ' one of Erasmus to
GocleniuS, 14 Dec. 1531, which precedes it in his volume (0¹)—misled Leclerc into
supposing that the two were contemporary. But, as there is no allusion to this letter
in the letter to Goclenius, Merula's meaning presumably was that the two Mss. were
folded up together, and tha-t in consequence he inierred that there was a con-
nexion between them. But he does not venture to assign a date.

Ι have adopted the shorter text, as being less elaborate and more like a letter;
and have put the readings of α in the notes, except in three places (ll. 13, 28, 78),
where they are obviously better. The enlarged form was repn'nted in Martens'
edition of Gal. Luc„ May 1 52 3, but not, so far as Ι know, again in any authorized
volume: being no doubt superseded by the more detailed defence, De militate
Colloquioram, put forward in 1526.]

QVVM res rumore tantum, sed probabili, ad me delata est, solum
in hoc respondebo nunc, ne quid per calumniam temere fiat, me non
audito. Iactitat quidam in nouis Colloquiis esse tria aut quatuor
loca in quibus sentiam cum Luthero, videlicet de consessione et

5 ieiunio. Id secus esse intelliget, qui libellum integer legerit.

Res ad me delata est, non solum rumore sed et amicorum haud sutilium literis,
et illa nominatim exprimentium, quibus verbis, quo loco, apud quos mihi intentata
sit calumnia per illum perpetuo sui similem, cuius etiam mores ac priora gesta
faciunt vt quod alioqui probabile futurum erat, pro comperto possit haberi.
Proinde non arbitratus sum mihi dissimulandum esse z praesertim apud vos
quorum partes erant tam effrenem hominis petulantiam, si non mea causa, certe
ordinis vestri gratia cohercere.

Iactat ac vociferatur in libello Colloquiorum quatuor esse loca plus quam haere-
tica : de esu carnium et ieiuni0‚ de indulgentiis ac de votis. Hoc quum ille fortiter
et impotenter asseueret, tamen secus habere comperiet quisquis libellum legerit in-
teger. Quod si cui non vacat eiusmodi nugas legere, rem paucis aperiam α.
