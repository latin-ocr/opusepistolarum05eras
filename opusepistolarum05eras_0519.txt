1458] FROM MARCUS LAURINUS 479

(cuius fidem satis expertus sum), 011111 veneris, fynanciarios exsolu-
turos pensionem tibi tam debitam ex terminis cessis quam cedendis. 60
Quam si maiorem petiueris, concedetur liberaliter. Etiam, si que
dignitas quantumcunque opulenta vacauerit, tibi conseretur. In
quibus omnibus suum tibi impartietur patrocinium. Hec voluit
vt suo nomine ad te scriberem haberesque pro certis. Nouisti
aulam. Quod domi habes, foris non queres. Ages igitur vt tibi 65
videbitur melius. Vale.

Commendant se tibi vidue, et Petrus Taelmannus: qui a te
edoctus nouit Latine dicere talitrum, quo sepius vexat monachos,
dicens illos nescire Latine, cum hoc ignorant. Rogauit is me vt
hec epistole mee insererem. Iterum vale. 70

[Some guidance as to the mouth-date can be obtained from Hedio's marriage,
which took place on 30 May 1 524 (Ep. 1452. 110-1 ). But on points 01 111110 Ε100111110’
words 011011 lack precision (01. Epp. 1143. 25n, 4911, 1488. 2211, 1555n) ; so
that it is not 0010 to assume that the wedding was quite recent. Possibly this
letter should be placed at about the same date as Ep. 1477.

Caspar Hedio or Hedius (1494-17 001. 1552), 0011 01 0 ropemaker at Ettlingen,
5 ms. s. 01 Carlsruhe, was a compatriot 01 1101110110 (Ep. 877. In) and perhaps
001100110110111 with him and Melanchthon at Piorzheim. Thence he matn'culated
at Freiburg 7 Jan. 1513, and was B.A. 1514, Μ.Α. 1516 (Schreiber, Geschs. Univ.
Freiburg, i. 97). At Whitsun 1518 he heard Zwingli preach at Einsiedeln (Zw.
ΕΖ. 98), and conceived a great admiration 101· him. On 7 April 1519 110 was
admitted to the Faculty of Theology at Basle, and worked under Bruno Amorbach
(Zw. ΕΖ. 102) and Capito; to whom he became closely attached. His intimacy
with Erasmus’ circle is shown by 1110 extension 10 111111 through Beatus (BRE. 156)
of the invitation to write to Dorp in Feb. 1520 (01. Ep. 1044. 4911). 011 23 June
1520 hc addressed Luthcr, courting acquaintance (LE2. 318) ; and a letter 01 1110
same date to Capito is preserved in the British Museum (Add. MS. 21524, 1. 5).
111 Oct. 1520 he followed Capito to Mainz and was appointed preacher (Zw. E2.
157). Η10 outlook was still conservative ; and Oecolampadius’ Epistola (Ep. 1308.
2611) was written, in answer to his inquiries, to reassure him about the changes
made. In spring 1523 110 succeeded Capito as preacher 01 1110 Court; and later
joined him at Strasbmg, where he became preacher at the cathedraI, the position
which Geiler († 1510) had held. He was quickly drawn into the current of Reform
at Strasburg (01. LE2. 847), and in that fellowship the rest of his life was spent.
On 30 May 1524 (Ep. 1452) 110 1110111οᾱ Margaret Trenz, daughter 01 0 Strasburg
gardener. His practical good-sense and soit-spoken moderation fitted him for
a mediator; and he did much to smooth the way 01 his party (of. Herminjard
183, 52511, 1 167 ; Bl. E. 623 ; VE. 1123), taking part in the Conferenccs at Marburg
in 1529, and at Bonn in 1543 (ef. ME. 2738).
