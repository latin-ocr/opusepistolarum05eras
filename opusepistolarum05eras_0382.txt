346 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1523

Frobenii‚ quod 7 florenos et d<imidium> 11160 1101111116 abs te acceperit,

15 cum ego satisfecerim plenissime Hieronymo eius filio z id quod puto
me dominationi tuae dixisse. Dedi ei plus minus sex florenos aureos.
Responderat tum Hieronymus habere se gratias mihi, nihil fuisse
patrem postulaturum si nihil dedissem ; quare vellem tibi pecuniam
male acceptam redderet.

ιο Siquid 1116 velis facere, nouisti hunc animum tibi deditissimum :
nihil poteris praestare mihi gratius quam onerare tuis mandatis.
Spongiam tuam vt multi dolent editam, ita admirantur plurimi,
ct praecipue Dorpius, quod omnia tam lepide diluis. Vale in Christo
felix, praeceptor et patrone vnice obseruande.

2 3 Antuerpiae nonis nouembribus 1523.

[For the elucidation 01 this letter I am entirely indebted to the kindness of
Dr. R. Wackernagel, late Staatsarchivar 01 Basle 3 who sent me detailed extracts
110111 the records 01 1116 City 01 Basle. The bookseller 101 whom Erasmus makes
this appeal‚ was a certain Benedict Vaugris or Wagri 01 Lyons, nephew to the
booksellers John Watenschnee and Conrad Resch, and therefore perhaps a kinsman
of Froben (61. Ep. 1335. 111). The records show that on 15 May 1522 Benedict-
was bound over 101· 6 year, 101 uniawful wounding (Todbuch 37) 3 and that on
5 Nov. 1523 he was released from prison, his sureties being John Watenschnee
and his brother John Vaugris‚ printer at Basle (Urfehdenbuch 3. 1), 101 whom
see Herminjard 119, 166, and Heitz and Bernoulli, Basler Bfwhermarken, 1895,
p. xxvii. On 12 March 1524 Benedict is mentioned as now living at- Constance
(61. Ep. 1519. 87) ; and his wife's name is given, Jacobe, widow 01 Lienhart Zschopp
(Urteilsbuch). Letters 01 Botzheim (EE. 54, 99) show that in 1526—9 Benedict was
still carrying on his business at Constance (61. Basle MS. C. Vla. 73. 219); but
61161· that I have no trace 01 him.

In view of his kinship it is possible to surmise who were the citizens that· moved
Erasmus to appeal on his behalf. The fine here mentioned probably had to do
with one or other of the two affairs3 perhaps the latter, since the trouble was
connected in some way with Benedict’s marriage. It may have been imposed on
his release from prison, as a mitigated penalty.

Erasmus tells the story 01 his intercession with some detail in a letter 01 1 Nov.
1533 (Lond. xxvii. 11, LB. 12 5 7). He describes it as having occurred ‘ ante annos
iam ferme decem ³, at a time when an English ambassador was in Basle (61. Ep.
1408. 24n) ; and states that Benedict subsequently showed base ingratitude.

Dr. Wackernagel’s communications confirm the year-date3 but a mouth-date
can only be conjecturaL]
