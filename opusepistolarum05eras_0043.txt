To CONRAD GOCLENIUS 13

Additurus eram operi nostro, sed erat

quur non fecerim. Miror quod Hilario dederis aureum ; nam erat
illi satis viatici ex me, et ex Petro Aegidio, de meo.
Scripsissem plura, sed hic parum videbatur notus, per quem 15

scribo. Campensi gratulor.

Decebat vt ego senex iam particeps

essem vestrarum felicitatum ; 88(1 video meos labores plane fuisse

Herculanos. Bene vale.

13. Hilario] H. Bertulphus of Lede,
between Alost and Ghent, was a pupil
of Eligius Houcarius at Ghent; and
some verses by him appear in Hou-
carius' D. Liuinz' vita, Paris, J. Badius
for some Ghent booksellers, 13 Jan.
1511. It was perhaps in consequence
of this early connexion that Bertulphus
sometimes calls himself ‘Gandauus'.
Subsequently he studied at Paris,
where he was a fellow-pupil of Vix es
(Ep. 1281. 88) and wrote some verses
for John Dullardus’ edition of Paulus

Venetus’ Summa philosophie naturalis,

Paria T. Kees, Nov. 1513; and then
he taught for some years at Toulouse
(Ep. 1403. 24-6). 111 1521 118 was at
Geneva, where he met Corn. Agrippa
and composed some complimentary
verses for him (Agr. E. pp. 807, 1148-
50). From 1522 to 1524 he was in
Erasmus' service, and was sent fre-
quently to Charles v (Agr. E. iii. 44) ;
and in Dec. 1523 carried to Francis 1
the presentation copy of the Paraphrase
on St. Mark (Ep. 1400). His reception
on that visit attracted him to return to
Franee; and though he went back to
Erasmus for a time (Herminjard 99),
by Nov. 1524 he was in France again
(Ep. 1516), and obtained service with
Margaret of Valois, Duchess of Alen90n
(Agr. E. iii. 72,3). Η8 endeavoured
also to draw Erasmus to follow him
(Horawitz v. 77).

About Sept. 1528 118 married (Lond. xx.
67, LB. 1004), and in Nov. 1531 was at
Brussels‚ as secretary to John Dantiscus
(EE. 162) 3 but subsequently he movcd
to Lyons, where he was intimate with
Rabelais in Nov. 1532 (EE. 182) and
worked for the printer Gryphius,
whom he provided with a copy of
Nic. Beraldus' De vetera ac nouitio,
iurisprudemia oratio, Lyons. 1 July

His only printed work of any impor-
tance is an edition of Ant. Nebrissensis’
Grammatica, Lyons, S. vincent, 152 3-
4: but there are verses by him, on
Reuehlin's death in Geldenhauer’s
Collecxanea, cd. Prinsen, 1901, pp. 142—

Bayard († 30 April 1524), in Symph.

(c. April 1527 ?> (BEr2. Adaq. 260):
and on Froben's death, in Erasmus’
Colloquia, Basle‚ H. Froben and
J. Herwagen, March 1529. In this last
volume appeared the synodus Gram-
maticorum, in which he is introduced
as a character. Ant. sanderus, De
Gcmdauenszssbus claris, 1624, p. 57, tells
an amusing story of Erasmus’ first
meeting with Bertulphus at Ghent.
When Sanderus wrote, several erudite
letters between them were still extant in
ms. ; but they are not now to be found.

1910, pp. 69-82 ; reprinted from Bull.

16. Campensi] John of Campen in
Over-yssel († 7 Sept. 15 38). Under the
influence of Luther and Melanchthon
he gave up the old theology (OE. p. 193),
and began the study of Hebrew in 1519.
ln 1520 118 was appointed professor
in Busleiden's college in succession to
Shirwood (cf. Ep. 1046. 2911). After
six years spent ‘infoeliciter discendo,
infoelicius etiam docendo ’ he tried to
find a successor to whom he might
resign, but was persuaded to continue.
A year in Germany in 1 52 5-6, including
avisit to Basia, increased his knowledge;
and on returning to Louvain he pro-
duced a Hebrew grammar, Th. Μαι-18118,
June 1528, based on the work of Elias
Levita. In 1531 he determined to
resign, and entered the service of John
Dantiscus‚ bp. of Culm, Polish am—
bassador at the Imperial court. On
their way to the Diet of Ratisbon he
publishcd at Nuremberg, J. Petreius,
1532, a Paiaphrase on the Psalms,
which quickly won popularity. The
publication had beon opposed at
Louvain, but Dantiscus insisted on
carrying it through (EE. 162). In
Oct. 1533 another attempt was made
to prevent its being translated into
Frcnch and Dutch (de Jongh p. 61*);
