Court‚ to Granada V alladolid, Madrid. Alcala. Two of his letters on this service
are printed by the Duchess of Berwick and Alva in Documentos escoqidoe del
archivo de la Casa de Alba, 1891, pp. 230,40. About 1530 hc was accused before
the Inquisition by the notorious Francisca Hernandez. Fonseca, whilst he lived,
protected him; but later thc charge of Lutheranism was again pressed by his
assailantS, and on 21 Dec. 1535 he was condemned to a sine and to imprisonment
which lasted till 27 Feb. 1537. His last years were spent at Toledo; where
Fonseca had presented him to a canonry.

His published work is scanty ; but he was a steady supportor of the humanists.
To Erasmus his devotion was sincere and lasting; as their later correspondcnce
shows, Carranza’ s first attaek on Erasmus (l. 2211) is dedicated to vernam. Vives,

IOANNES VERGARA ERASMO ROTERODAMO S.

APOLOGIAM qua Stunicae Annotationibus respondisti, Romam ad
Stunicam ipsum cum mitterem (et missurum me retuleram tibi in
aede diui Petri Louaniensis), hortabar amicum hominem per
literas vt ibi tandem finem contentionum statueret, neglectisque

sleuibus offensiunculis iniret tecum gratiam erudit-is iuxta omnibus
ambiendam: in ea concilianda si quis mei vsus esse posset, eius
commoditatibus non defuturum. Admonebam Leicorum conatuum,
quam ingrati· doctis omnibus accidissent, quam Leo ipsi inglorii.
Addebam denique in admirationem tui non pauca sed, praeut sentio,

¹0 paucissima. Hisce ille haud magnopere commotus adeo factum
mutare non videtur, vt longe etiam atrocius bellum deintegro
indicat, per epistolam quam ad me dedit saeuam, criminosam,
fulmineam: non iam tela, nons picula, sed tragulas, balistas
catapultasque minitantem, quibus vniuersos iam nunc aduersarios

⁴¹5 late ruit, agit, Wget, prosternit. Οὔκ ἀνταπολογίσειν μὲν μόνον ἀλλὰ
καὶ τὴν μὲν δευτέραν τῆς Νέας Διαθήκης ἔκδοσιν, ἔτι δὲ καὶ τὰ εἷς Ἱερώνυμον
σχόλια ἅλλα τε τῶν ὑπό σου συγγεγραμμένων πολλά, μυρίων πταισμάτων
βρύοντα καὶ τῆς Λουθεριανῆς ἀσεβείας μετέχοντα, ἀποδείξειν μάλα φανερῶς.

facta sint in scripta tua maximo impetu inuasuri.
