optimus, vt audio, fuerat restitutus per aulam. Eum arte retraxe-
rant in arcem quandam : ibi conuicissent illum haereseos—nam hic
Ecmondanus felicius argumentatur quam in scholis—‚ verum ilico

liberatus est per Hollandiae proceres.

ausus sit cum Ecmondano disputare. Cornelius restitutus est, sed

diu passus indigna. Nunc demum restitut-us est et N icolaus noster,
vir integerrimus. Nec dubito quin his succurrerit Pontificis aequitas ;
rectius tamen factura, si tales, qui suis moribus cunctis et bonis et
malis inuisi sunt, exarmaret, praesertim in tam arduo negocio. 35
Quaeso te, Carmelitam istum tanta armare autoritate, quid aliud
erat quam furioso tradere gladium ‘t Ego constanter sic me geram,
vt exitus declaraturus sit me nihil aliud spectare quam Christi

gloriam et publicam vtilitatem.

Nuper quoniam oblatus erat Praepositus quidam, canonicus apud 40

diuum Donatianum Brugis‚ homo certus sed mox abiturus, scripsi
plus quam ex tempore Pontifici, satis libere et haud scio an temere,
certe animo syncero. Vix erat ocium relegendi quod scripsissem.
Bona spes est illius humanitatem boni consulturam hanc simplicis
animi fiduciam. Hic mihi Visus est parum certus ε vnde paucioribus 45
ago, plura scripturus vbi contigerit cui tuto possimus fidere. Bene

vale, vir optime.

To HERMAN LETHMATIUS.

Basle.
17 April 1523.

[This letter is the companion to Ep. 1345, but unhappily the original has not
survived,—-only Henry Lethmatius' copy at Gouda (a¹ : see p. 234) ; from which,
since he reproduces the evident depravation in l. 14, Almeloveen‚ in his Amoeni-
tates, 1694, p. 65 (αἳ), must have printed: his addition of the sumame in the

address notwithstanding.

The Staatsbibliothek at Munich (Cam. 33, f. 173) has

a late copy (β), the variants of which have no value ; but which in the absence
of the original, may serve to confirm the text-if the copy was not made from αἳ,
with which it agrees in the depravation of l. 14. LB. reprints a².]

shown to Luther by Hinne Rode (cf.

c. 1522 and rejected by him; but was
printed by Zwingli <Zurich‚ Frosehover,
1525> (cf. O. Clemen in ZKG. xviii,
1898, pp. 347--8). In Feb. 1523 he
was arrested on a charge os heresy, and
transported by Hulst (l. 24) 3 but was
released in March through, the inter-
vention of Margaret of Austria (Frede-
ricq iv, no. 125), only to be retained in
custody at the Hague, until let out on
bail by the Council in Oct. (ibid., nos.
152, 172; cf. Ep. 1394. 10—12). Corn.
Gerard of Gouda (Ep. 17 introd.), who
was an intimate friend, addressed to
him during that period a letter of
comfort, De Patientia (NAKG. ii,
1902, pp. 32-5); and later (ο. Sept.

1524> forwarded to him his Apoca-
lypsis for safekeeping. Gerard's accom-
sazsswt (1131111 {siries
that Hoen had long been a friend of
Erasmus; and thus gives ground for
identifying him with the person
addressed in Ep. 1166: cf. also Ep.
1044. 69n. See LE². 552n3 De Hoop
