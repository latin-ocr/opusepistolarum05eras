LETTERS OF ERASMUS

Nouit audaciam Hutteni.

20 Adheret Ecbano et Vrbano. Vtrumque tibi commendo.

[1524

Amat te vehementer.
Ionas,

Sohalbus, Draco, Crotus a nostra sodalitate defecerunt ad Luthe-

ranOS .

Ecbanus resipuit meo hortatu, vere simplicis et candidi

ingenii. Eant alii in ledendis hominibus occupati. Ego phanaticos

lapidatores non amo.

Frustra monemus; vt praetor ait, ‘ Vim
25 fieri veto'. Euocant Vestales. Ferociunt tanquam insani. Interim

Erasmiana lectio tranquillis nobis et fructum affert et voluptatem.

Vale, doctor clarissime.

out to me that he had rendered great
service by putting Luther's theology
into form in the Loci Communes, Wit-
tenberg, s. n„ <Dec.> 1521.

20. Eobano] See Ep. 8743 and, for
Mutianus' connexion with him and
with Erfurt, Ep. 870. Eobanus'
struggle at this time against the
Lutheran party in Erfurt is described
in Krause‘s life i. 352-80.

Vrbano] Henry Fastnacht († p.
{133{³12&jsa’dssfflssfflsssssstssssefffirssfiffi03ss
and F ulda, matriculated at Erfurt at
Easter 1494, but left the University to
enter the Cistercian house at Georgental,
ὅ ms. s. of Gotha. About 1505 he made
the acquaintance of Mutianus, whose
513²AE laffissdfffi ἰἓΠὲὴὶἳ-ῗῖιξέ ⁰131?AE
of Mutianus’ existing correspondence is
addressed. Later he was allowed to go
to Leipzig and graduate B.A. 1508,
M.A. 15103 after which he was ap-
pointed to preside over the house main-
tained by his monastery at Erfurt
University. He pursued there a life
of study, in close sympathy with
Mutianus; but the destruction of
Georgental in 1525 brought his peace
to an end, and most of his last years
were spent in penury. See MRE.
pp. viii-x, MRE2. 3n, and pp. xxix-
xxxiv; also ii, pp. 298—301.

Ionas] See Ep. 876.

21. Schalbus] See Ep. 977.

Draco] See Ep. 871.

Crotus] Rubianus: John Jeger
(o. 1480—p. 1540) of Dornheim, 16 ms.
ΒΕ. of Gotha. He matriculated at
Erfurt 111 the summer of 1498 and was

B.A. 1500, M.A. 1508. By 1501 he
had made the acquaintance of Luther
and soon was the close friend of Hutten.
In 1510 118 was appointed headmaster
of the abbey school at Fama, and
became a priest. His sympathjes were
progressive, and he supported first
Reuchh'n and then Luther with eager-
ness 3 taking with Hutten a large share
in Eov. From 1517 to 1520 he was in
Italy ‘as tutor to some young men
named Fuchs‚ and visited Bologna and
Rome. Returning to Erfurt 16 Oct.
1520 118 was elected Rector of the
University 18 Oct., and on 6 April
1521 welcomed Luther who was on his
way to Worms. After some years at
Fulda again, he went to Konigsberg as
councillor to Duke Albert of Branden-
burg (see Ep. 1297. 54n) 1524—9. By
the end of that time he had begun
to see the dangers of reform, and
reverted to the conservative side;
accepting a canonry at Halle in
1531 from the Abp. of Mainz. This
brought him violent defamation from
the Reformers; which saddened his
later years.

See ADB, EE, and Knod 3140.
Though of similar temperament to
Erasmus, he seems to have had no
direct intercourse with him.

ences to my friend Mr. W. W. How.
