1277] FROM JOHN VERGARA 53
est veluti exploratorius, minime quidem Stunica ipso authore, qui
videlicet maiores ordines ducat, sed Sanctio Carranza Mirandensi
Hispano, inter Complutenses theologos magni loci atque nominis, 25
qui Hispaniae Ecclesiae negocia Romae tractat. Is quod ex literis
ad Stunicam meis intellexerit quam te faciam magni quamque sim
clarissimae istius eruditionis admirator, nimirum existimauit id
iudicii ex magna tecum consuetudine familiaritateque prodiisse.
Ea re libellum ad me tanquam ad amicum tuum misit, dicataque 30
in vestibulo epistola rogat, animum in te suum minime maleuo-
lentem, sed aequum prorsus et obseruantem tui vt aperiam tibi.
Atque adeo haec ex epistola ipsa tute multo melius Mihi id addere
visum, hominem esse argutae philosophiae theologiaeque con-
sultissimum3 acri ingenio, iudicio exacto, multa in literis illis 33
exercitatione, καὶ ὅλως ἐπὶ ταῖς τῶν φιλοσοφικῶν λεπτολογημάτων διατριβαῖς
ἐν ὀλίγοις εὐδόκιμον, adhaec moribus quidem probis et modestis et
minime morosis. Vnde adducor vt credam non odio aut liuore ad
haec scribenda animum adiecisse, sed studiosa quapiam nec immo-
desta contentione prouectum, qualis inter viros doctos de rebus 40
literatis nullo beneuolentiae dispendio esse solet. Caetera tu ex
libri lectione longe me peruestigabis sagacius 3 de quo nullum interim
esto meum praeiudicium.

De me vero ita velim sentias, vt de homine bonarum literarum
cupientissimo ; ita enim fiet vt vna etiam opera Erasmi studiosum 45
agnoscas, cuius ego causam semper putaui cum honestarum disci-

After studying in Paris he became of Alcala. He had returned there by

in St. Peter’s a sermon De (ἰιῖαίηο amore,

which Burchard (ii. 281) describes as
⁶ prolixum nimis et tediosum, cum Pape
et omnium indignatione ’. On return-
ing to Spain he received a post in the
cathedral at Seville, and was appointed
to chairs, first of philosophy and then
of theology, at Aleala, where he became
Fellow of thc College of 81. lldefonsoin

returned again to Alcala, where Sepul-
vcda was his pupil for three years. 116
is also credited with I'roqymmwmala
Loqicalia, l'aris, J. Petit, 1517. In
1520 hc went 10 Rome with Alvar
Albornoz on behalf of the Spanish
Church, and in passing Bologna visited
the Spanish Collega and his old pupils

Leo x during his last visit to Rome.

He was a theologian rather than
a humanist (of. Ciceronianus, LB. i.
1015 C), and his present criticisms of
Erasmus were on these lines. In spite
of their moderate tone they roused
Erasmus to reply, with an Apoloqia
(see 1. 2211), which, though 61 first re-
strained, soon broke out into his usual
impatience. But through the influence
of friends, and Carranza’s good sense,
Erasmus was before long appcased:
