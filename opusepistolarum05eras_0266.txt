1346. To THE NUNs oF (YOLOGNE.
Ratio verae Theologiae‚ (1523). {¹20⁴ v¹¹ (a). (Bane.)
LB. 666. (c. February> 1523.

[The opening and concluding passages of the Vz'rqinis et Mmtyris Comparatio,
written in response to a request, supported by prescnts of sweetmeats, from
the Benedictine nuns of Cologne‚ with whose warden, Helias Mareaeus, Erasmus
had been for some years on friendly terms: see Epp. 842, 1475. For the arche-
type (α) I have adopted the edition of the Ratio verae Theoloqz‘ae discussed in Ep.
1 36 5 introd. In Sept. 1524 at Marcaeus’ request Erasmus enlarged this letter into
a little treatise (β), and printed it with the De immensa Dei misericordia Concio
(Ep. 1474); where it fills 49 pageS‚ of somewhat sma-ller content, instead of 7.
ιι is reprinted in the Cologne edition of Deo. 1523 ; β 111 Froben editions of Oct. 1524,
‘ex recognitione autoris'‚ and Sept. 1529 (γ), where it is combined with the De
pueris instituendis and other small works of Erasinus (see Epp. 603-4, 799, 1 194).
Leclerc appears to have used for his text, here and in Ep. 1365, a copy of α z for
the three misprints he proposes in his notes to correct are found in that text,
but not in the Cologne edition. β appears in its right place among Erasmus’
moral writings in the Basle Opera of 1540, v. 493, and 111 LB. v. 589.

The opening words of Ep. 1475 show that the amplification of α into β was
the result of a request made some time before ; perhaps at the sending of sweet-
meats as a strena 101· the New Year of 1524. The year-date given in the text
below is confirmed by the existence of the Cologne reprint of Dec. 1523. This
letter may therefore be taken to be a response to a strena for 1523—a suggestion
which indicates a conjectural mouth-date 3 and from the first three words it seems
that the nuns must have begun their pleasant practice at the New Year of 1522.

Like the De . . . Dei misericordia this pietistic work rapidly attracted notice,
and demand for it in the vernaeulars arose. The following translations are noted
in BEr1. ; into German 1533, into English by Thomas Paynel 1537, into Flemish
.>. a. ; into Italian 1554, into Dutch 1616, into Freneh 1712.]
