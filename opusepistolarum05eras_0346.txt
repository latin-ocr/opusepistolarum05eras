312 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1523

1380. FnoM CHARLES V To MARGARET OF AUSTRIA.

Brussels MS. Valladolid.
22 August 1523.

[An original document 111 the Royal Archives 01 Brusscls, Archives de l’Audience ε
printed by A. Pinchart in MSH. 1858, p. 394, and again in his Arelez'vcs des Aris,
Sciences 01 Lettrcs ii, 1863, p. 43. Αο with Ep. 691, Pinchart‘s original cannot
now bc found. Gaehard's itinerary (ii. 34) confirms Charles· presence at
Valladolid 01 1110 date given.

Erasmus’ imperial pension had not been paid since his departure from Louvain in
Oct. 1521 : see Epp. 1319. 18, 1585. His earlier remindcrs to his Court patrous
may be read in Epp. 1273, 1275, 1276 ; but of 1110 later pctitions which reached
Charles himself and movcd him to send these instructions 110 11000 survives. See,
however, Ep. 1585. It seems as though Erasmus had heard of this letter by
Jan. 1524: see the references in Epp. 1408, 1409, 1417, 1418, 1422, to Charles‘
directions that 110 should return to Brabant. But the first definite mentions
of it are in Epp. 1434. 27-8, 1466. 53-4. For subsequent negotiations about his
pension see Ep. 1645 introd.]

1381. To HENRY VIII.
Paraphrasis in Euang. Lucae, f0. Aa2. Basle.
Lond. xxix. 70: LB. vii. 271. 23 August 1523.

[The preface to Erasmus’ Paraphrase on St. Luke. Unlike the two earlier
Paraphrases on the Gospels (Epp. 1255, 1333), this did not appear first in one of
Froben’saehandsome foHos, but in a small octavo (cf.‚ however, Ep. 1414 z but there
the choice of the octavo issue to be sent first to Clement was no doubt due to the
convenience of carriage by post-horse) dated 30 Aug. 1523 (α). Other Froben
editions, each described as ‘ per autorem recognita ⁹, are an octavo of 152 3-4 (β),
folios of 1524 (γ) and 1526 (δ), 011 octavo of 1534 (ε) and 0 folio of 1535 (ζ); and
these are followed by two issues in vol. vii of the collected Opera, 1540 (η) and 1541
(θ). This preface appears to have been written in haste, and set up in α without
much care; for a good deal of correction was necessary in β, and one faulty con-
struction (l. 171) survived to be corrected as late as η. But after β the variants
are mainly sporadic. From those in Jl. 262, 284, 401, 419, it 10 01001 11101 Lond.
was printed from θ. It is noticeable that in hjs citations here from the New
Testament, Erasmus contrary to his custom (cf. Epp. 1304. 43011, 1365. 111, 1400.
Hssn ε also Ep. 858. 53on)jgives the Vulgate rendering instead of his own, except in

. 102, 22 , 23 .

The Am7erba⁵ch correspondence shows that Erasmus had already begun upon
the Paraphrase by 23 April (Basle MSS. G. II. 13. 136, 29. 119) and that on 22 June
the printing was in progress (G. ΙΙ. 13. 145). It seems almost 00 though on the
material side of his dedications, Erasmus was not as punctilious as might have been
expected in one who on paper certainly knew how to show himself a good courtier.
