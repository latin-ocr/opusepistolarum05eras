1284] TO NICHOLAS BERALDUS 65

Caesaream's et Gallis, sed pulchre conuenit honestissimorum stu-
diorum sodalibus. Quare valebis, vir humanissime, simulque quum
dabitur oportunitas, Budaeum, Deloinum, Brixium ac reliquos
amicos meo nomine salutabis diligenter.

1285. FROM JOHN ΒΟΤΖΗΕΙΜ.

Breslau MS. Rehd. 254. 38. Constanoe.

EE2. 16. <26 May ⁴2> 1522.

[An original letter, autograph throughout: the address-sheet is lost. First
printed by K. Hartfelder in Zs. f. Gesch. d. Oberrhez'ns, NF. viii, 1893, p. 29. The
year-date is confirmed by Ep. 1279; but the month-date is in a form scarcely
tenable. It is sometimes interpreted as 7 May3 but Praiis and his eompanion
could not have travelled from St. Georgenberg to Constance in one day. Possibly

Botzheim began by dating on 26 May; and then, if Praiis' Journey was delayed,
altered to 1 June without erasing the 26]
