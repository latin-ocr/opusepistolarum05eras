14 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

1258.
Deventer MS. 99, f. 6 v0.

[1522

{Po <BLARTTN·I)AVIDTS?>.

Basle.
9 February 1522.

[A sixteenth-century copy in the manuscript from which comes Ep. 296, and by
the same hand. The dates are amply confirmed by the contents. The person addres-
sed evidently was some confidential friend of Erasmus, perhaps Martin Davidts.
This might easily be a reply to a second letter written shortly after Ep. 12 54.]

but this too failed. One French ver-
sion appeared in 1534, 8. l., and Dolet
issued another at Lyons, 1542 (R. O.
Christie, Dolet, 1899, p. 537). A Dutch
version was printed at Delft, C. Henrici,
13 July 15343 and an English version
in London, Τ. Gybson, 1539. In a
reprint of the original, Paris, s. n„ 1532,
a Paraphrase on Ecclesiastes by Cam-
pensis was added, seemingly without
his knowledge, and likewise from notes
of his lectures at Louvain.

After two years with Dantiscus,
during which he spent six months in
W. Pmssia and. visited Marienburg,
he was invited in 1533 by Peter
Tomiczki, bp. of Cracow, to fill the
Hebrew chair in that university.
During his tenure he produced a Para-
phrase on the Proverbs of Solomon,
Cracow, F. Unglerius‚ s. a., with a pre-
iace to Tomiczki, 19 Feb. 1534; a com-
mentary on Romans and Galatians,
Cracow, M. Scharfenberg 1534, dedi-
cated to meander, 27 Feb. ; and a new
edition of his Hebrew grammar, ibid„

that he could no longer resist a tempta-
tion which had been before him since
the previous autumn (Lond. xxx. 62,
LB. 12583 cf. OE. p. 193)——to go to
Venice and meet Elias Levita, who was
there with Aleander. In Feb. 1535
110 was invited to Rome to teach
Hebrew (Basle MS. Goelenii Epist.‚
f. 12 v0). and accepted; but after
a few years decided to return to Ger-
many‚ where he died at Freiburg.

He made the acquaintance of Martin
Lypsius in Feb. 1524 (Horawitz v. 87,
42). Seb. Munster dedicated to him
the Loyica of Rabbi Simeon, Basle,
Froben, 1527.

1. Franciscus] Berckman.

scrinium] Cf. Epp. 1254. 17, 1275.
9—10.

3. Priore] Probst; cf. Epp. 1254.
8—16, 1256. 23-4.

4. Oecolampadius] On 23 Jan. 1522
110 left Altomiinster‚ where he had been
living since c. 23 April 1520: see Ep.
1095. 1741111, and Binder, op. cit„
p. 286. He wrote to Erasmus and
Beatus Rhenanus ‘vt omnium amicis-
simis ’, ‘ ad tacitissimos ’, explaining his
action (BRE. 222. 1-5) ; but the letter
has not survived. From another of his
letters at this period (Oec. E.‚ f. 204),
it seems to have been written in despon-
dency about the future, both private
and public: ‘ N on scribam τραγικωτέρως,
vt nuper ad Erasmum nostrum ;
quamuis satis atrox, quioquid id infor-
tunii est, videtur. Obuersatur enim
ante oculos, quis rerum mearum
status ‘3 . . . quis finis rerum sperandus
sub his principibus ἶ) ’

5. Dux Bauarie] William 1v (13 Nov.
149 3-6 March 1 5 5o)‚who had succeeded
his father 18 March 1508. For his
support of Rome at this time see
Ranke, Resormation, bk. 3, eh. 5. On
5 March 1522 he issued a mandate
requiring strict orthodoxy from all his
sub'ects.

61. dissidium] This repert was per-
haps untrue; cf. BRE. 222, Oecolam-
padius to BeatuS, 15 April 1522,
⁶ Principes nunc simulant sese mihi
optime voluisse, atque conditionem
honestam offerunt Ingolstadii ² : where
Eck was Professor of Theology.
