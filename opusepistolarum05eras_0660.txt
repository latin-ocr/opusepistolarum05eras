APPENDIX XVI

A DUBIOUS LETTER OF ERASMUS

AT Cracow in July 1922 Professor J. Fijalek, rector magnificus,
among much other information generously communicated, shewed
me a number of the Kwartalnilc H istoryczny, LWOW, xiv, 1900 ; in
which, on p. 50, Dr. J. Kallenbach had printed, with some miscella-
neous notes gathered in Italian librarieS, a letter of Erasmus men-
tioning a visit to Poland. It came from a book in the Trivulziana
at Milan, the Operetla volyavre of messer Iacobo Philippo Pelle Negra
Troiano 3 a volume of devotional poetry in Italian, addressed with
some wedding verses to Bona Sforza on her marriage to Sigismund of
Poland at Cracow, 18—20 April 1518. There is no preface; but
prefixed to these poems, 011 f0. Α2 recto and verso, is the letter of
Erasmus, dated from Basle 1 March 1524, and describing an
interview with Queen Bona when representing the Emperor at the
recent wedding festivities.

Through the kindness of Prince Trivulzio and the Conservator of
his Library, Dr. A. Giulini, I have received photographs of the whole
book, except ff. 0 and 08, which are missing ; and have thus been
able to examine it with care. It is a small octavo, without name of
printer or date on the title-page ; the verso of that is blank, and
the book ends on f0. 07 170. with a table of contents. The missing
colophon can be supplied, however, from a complete copy which was
in the Crevenna Catalogue, Amsterdam, 1789 (IIIb, p. 36 ; cf.
Panzer viii. 484) : Venice, N. Zopino and V. Compagno, 10 March
1524. Besides the occasional verses 1110 Operetta contain poems in
praise 01 the Virgin, prayers of Ambrose, Augustine, Gregory, and
Anselm, translations of Psahn 108 and of the Te Deum, prayers to be
said at the elevation of 1110 11051, and before and after communion,
and a few others

Erasmus’ letter 15 printed 11010 according to the lines and punctua-
tion of the original. The reasons for doubting its genuineness are
many :

1. The name of Ingold, though known 10 Erasmus, only appears
once in his correspondence (Ep. 305. 120n) ; and there is no
evidence to corroborate the statement in ll. 41—2 that he had taken
a frequent part in sending Erasmus' writings to the printers.

2. If Erasmus had ever gone 10 Poland, it 15 difficult to suppose
that there would be no allusion to the visit, either in his letters of
that period, or in his subsequent letters to his numerous Polish
friends ; especially when he wrote to Sigismund on 15 May 1527—on
which occasion he describes himself as ‘ ignotus ' to the King.

3. The Emperor’s representative at the weddjng was Casimir of
Brandenburg, with a retinue of knights; and the only man of
