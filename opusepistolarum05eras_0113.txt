¹²⁸³l2981313 FROM DUKE GEORGE oF SAXONY.

Louvain MS. Dresden.
Gran. E. 9. 9 July 1522.

[A xv1‘0. transcript, among Cranevelt’s papers about to be published by Prof. de
Vocht (Gran. Ε.) : on a gathering of six leaves, numbered 46—51 and all written
by the same hand. The contents of these leaves are ε

(1) the Bull of Leo x to Henry vm, 11 Oct. 1521 (Brewer iii. 1659), about the

Assertio septem Sacoamentorum (ll 7-9);
(2) a Responsio on the part of Ferdinand, the Electors, and others at the Diet

of Nuremberg‚ Jan 1523 to articles proposed by the Papa} Nuncio3

(3) this letter and its answer, Ep. 1313.
In view of Cranevelt's ties with Erasmus, it is antecedently probable that these

letters should have come to him from that side rather than from Saxony. And this
inference is borne out by the facts. For, though in the absence of the original
of this letter, the words which the copyist has written between the dates and the
signature, ‘ Ex originali sic subscripto' (1. 43), give no clear indication 01ς source, in
Ep. 1313 the case is different, and the words in a similar place there, ‘Signatum
manu propria Erasmi sic’ ‚are decisive3 since the actual letter which Duke George
received, now at Dresden, has no signature. The Dresden MS„ however, is not the
letter as first sent, but a duplicate copy made later from the rough- drast, to
rep lace the first, which had been intercepted and destroyed (see p. 12 5 ). As the
Louvain MS. of Ep. 1313 agrees closely with the Dresden MS„ only differing in
a few readings, some of which are better, it seems clear that it was derived from
the first draft of the letter, and not from the printed texts, into which some varia-
tione were introduced. For obvious reasons it could not have been made in
Saxony, since the first copy never arrived there, and the duplicate has no signature ε
so that we may infer with great probability that the six ms. leaves now at Louvain
were copied, for transmission to Cranevelt, by one of Erasmus’ servant-pupils
at Basle. But Ι (10 not recognize the hand. From the position of these letters
on ff. 49-51‚ following the Responsio of J an. 1 52 3, it is evident that they must have
been copied later: and therefore not from the lost letter before its dispatch, but
from Erasmus’ rough-draft, which accordingly appears to have had his signature.

Prof. de Vocht's discovery fills in a gap ; with the happy result that we now have
the correspondence between Erasmus and Duke George for the years 1522-4
almost complete]
