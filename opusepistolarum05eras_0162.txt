employment for him ; 0011 00 1 Sept. 1 52 3 Heresbach was installed as tutor to the
young Duke William of Clevcs—a post which hc held till 1 5 34, when he was appointed
councillor. In these years he formed an intimate friendship with John Vlatten
(Ep. 1390) 3 and revised Valla's translations of Herodotus and Thucydides, Cologne‚
Oervicomus. 1526,7. In 1529 110 received a prebend at Xanten and 1110 provostship
of Rees (EE. 105); but gave up this prefermcnt in 1535-6 111 order to marry.
His later years were spent on his official duties, and in the management of an estate
belonging to his wife on an island in the Rhine below Wcsel. This interested him
so much that he composed a dialogue De re rustica, Cologne, Jo. Birckmann, 1570 ;
which was translated into English by Barnabc Googe, 1577. Of his other numerous
writings the most noteworthy arc a treatise on education, 1570, and a commentary
on the Psalms. cditcd by Sturrn, with a short life of him, 1578. He correspondcd
with Mclanchthon and Camerarius ; and was closely attached to Erasmus, to
whom 110 wrote frequently, though few of tho letters survive. This attachment he
imparted to his pupil; cf. Lond. xxiv. 8, LB. 1061 and App. 353.

to him an edition of Horace, Basle, Val. Curio, 1 April 1527.]

ERASMVS ROTEROD. CONRADO HERESBACHIO S.

NAE tu minimum abes a beatitudine, doctissime Conrade, qui
tantula re beari possis. Scribis enim te fore protinus beatum, si
contingat Erasmus hospes. Mira vero felicitas quam inuideas
Constantiae caeterisque oppidulis‚ quae dignatus sum, vt scribis,

5 mea praesentia. Imo ipse meam ipsius infelicitatem deploro z qui
tot malis onustus sum, vt quoquo locorum me conferam, non solum
ipse mihi molestus sim, ob morbi inclementiam 00 valetudinis
incommoditatem, verum iis etiam molestus esse cogar quibus
cuperem esse iucundissimus.

family established in the neighbourhood

St. Mary's at Erfurt3 by 1487-8 he
held canonries at 0008100110, Basle,
Chur, and was an apostolic protono-
tary3 and in May 1496 was elected
Bp. of Constance. He was at first
inclined to resist encroachments by the
Papacy in the matt-er of indulgenees,
and to support Zwingli; but later he

and settled at Meersburg (Ep. 1401.
1311). After appointing Balthasar
Mercklin (Ep. 1382. 25n) his coadjutor
in 1527, he definitely resigned to him
in 1529. But Mercklin's death com-
pelled him to resume the see. 30 June
1531, for the last months of his life.

He was a consistent patron of John
Faber (Ep. 386); and Erasmus writes of
him here and in Epp. 1331.2‚ 1342. 361-
7 3, with great respect (cf. also Cat. Duc„
Ι, p. 46. 23—5). But his persecution of
Botzheim in 1524—6 (see Ep. 1519 in-
trod.) shows him in a less pleasantlight.
Ambr. Blaurer writes of him in 1522
(Bl. E. 43): ‘ Nihil ex suopte pectem
sapit, sed totus pendet exfaliis '.
