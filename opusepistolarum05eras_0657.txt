N. p. 591 ε Lond. xviii. 38 : LB. 722. 27 December 1524.

[Ι cannot confirm the year· -3date but it receivse some corroboration from
Ep. 1 54 4,which' 1s addressed to Besancon.

Of the Cluniae monk addressed I cannot discov er any thing more than is contained
in this letter. Evidently he had been visiting Basle; and he was perhaps still
there, and about to carry letters and greetings for friends of Erasmus whom he
would pass at Besancon aynd Dole on his way to Cluny. ]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS EVSTACHIO ANDREAE, MONACHO
OLVNIACENSI, S. D.

FRATER in Christo charissime. Singularis tuus in me affectus,
quem non tam oratione quam fronte, quod aiunt, ipsa, quam oculis,
quam toto vultu loquebaris, facit vt non possim te non redamare,
nisi velim haberi omnium inhumanissimus. At vereor ne tibi vsu
venerit quod de Ixione narrant fabulae, qui pro Iunone nubem 5
amplexus est. Superest autem vt nostros labores, quibus tam
impense faues, precibus tuis adiuues : te veroin amicorum numerum
perquam lubens recipio, non defuturus officio meo, si quid extiterit
in quo possim tibi gratum facere.

Salutabis mihi duos fratres humanissimos iureconsultos, quorum 10
in colloquio nostro inciderat mentio : praeterea doctissimum iuxta
et humaniss. doctorem, qui mihi olim notus Mechliniae, me salu-
tauit Besontii. Nam praeter nomen nihil illius excidit mihi.

Tu fac sic inuigiles honestis studiis vt ordini tuo possis et orna-
mento esse et vsui. Abbatis dignitas non est quidem ambienda, 15
sed ea tamen vltro sequetur virtutes tuas. Bene vale.

[The year-date is confirmed by the mention of the Loretto Mass (l. 19), which
Erasmus enlarged just about this time.

Leonard of Gruyeres belonged to a Swiss family of position, whose castle is still
to be seen in the mountains between Fribourg and Lausanne. He became canon of
Besancon 3 March 1507 (Besancon Archives, G. 25 0, p. 2,) and later Archdeacon of
Salius and official to the Archbishop, Ant. de V ergy, with v. hom ho was established

counteract French influence in Switzerland; soe his journals and papers kept at
that period (Besancon MS. 1145). He died at Ghent 2-3 April 1540, when on
a mission to Charles v in connexion with tho prosecution of Simon Gauthiot
