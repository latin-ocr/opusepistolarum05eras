1396. FROM THOMAS BLAURER.

Leipzig MS. Constancc.
ΕΕ. 2ο. 17 November 1 52 3.

[Α11 original letter, autograph throughout, with a linc lost at the top of the
page. In view of the reference to Ep. 1342 the year-date may be accepted.

Ambrose (4 April 1492—6 Dec. 1564) and Thomas Blaurer († 1567) were the sons
of a town-councillor at Constance. Ambrose graduated at Tubingen (matric.
1504-5, Β.Α. 23 Dec. 1511, M.A. 24 June 1513) and made there the acquaintance of
Melanchthon. While still at the University‚ he entered the Benedictiue Abbey of
Alpirsbach in the Black Forest (see Ep. 1120 introd), and had perhaps already
made his profession by 1510. Thomas matriculated at Freiburg 27 Nov. 1514,
and was a pupil of Zasius in law ; but left 111 the spring of 1519 without graduating,
because of the plague. Late in 1520 he went to Wittenberg, and began the study
oi theology and Hebrew ; and coming under the influence of Luther and Melanch·
thon, sent their books to Alpirsbach. Ambrose, who meanwhile had become Prior,
was moved by these, and on 5 J uly 1522 left the monastery.

At the time of this letter Thomas had recently returned from Wittenbcrg, and
settled at Constance ; where he married and entered upon a civic career, bcconiing
one of the chief men of the town. Ambrose was facing steadfastly the opposition
which his action aroused both from his mother and sisters and from the ecclesias-
ucal authorities, and was resisting all endeavours to draw or force him back to
Alpirsbach. He became in course of time one of the leaders of the movclucnt for
reform in Constance‚ married in 15 33, and in 1534 went to spread the Reformation
in Swabia under the restored Duke Ulrich of WVurtemberg (cf. Ep. 1285. 1511).
111 1540 he returned to Constance, and lived there with great happiness and influ-
cnce. But on the capitulation of the town to Charles v and Ferdinand in 1548,
the brothers were obliged to fiee, and they died in exile. Sec ADB. ii. 691— 3, and
ssl. E. For Erasmus’ warm feelings towards them at this time sce the words that
he added in 1524 to Cat. Luc. (1, p. 46. 20—1) 3 and for Ambrosc’s consideration for
lum cf. Ep. 1342. 81511. Zasius dedicated to Thomas his Apoloqetica Defensio
contra loannem Eckium, Basle, Froben, March 1519 (ΖΕ. 251). Κ. Walchner in his
life of Botzheim, 1836, p. 180, mentions an account by Thomas of the execution
of the Anabaptist‚ Louis Hetzer, printed at Strasburg, 1529 (cf. Bl. E 134, 135) :
