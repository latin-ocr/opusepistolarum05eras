FROM ULRICH ZASIUS 31

niciosam nostrae Vniuersitatis cum Ciuitate dissensionem, quae
adeo increscit vt nec Velius a periculo abfuerit superiori nocte,

nec alii viri docti.

Ego, nisi res in melius vergat, cedere loco

statui, Capitonis consilio Moguntiam profecturuS‚ vbi nunc lectio 25
ordinaria vacat ε diutius enim in hisce periculis versari nolo, quae
si amarem, dignus essem qui in iis perirem. Ego monendo, con-
sulendo, vociferando denique ad concordiam inuitaui vtranque
partem: non proficiens hilum. Quid igitur mihi spei reliquum
est quo me ipsum consoler ἰ) Malo igitur in tempore mutare locum 30
quam accepto detrimento demum effugere, ne ipse mihi defuisse

dicar.

Vale, nostri seculi ornamentum.

To STANISLAUS Tunzo.

Basle.
21 March (1522).

[The year-date may be altered with confidence in view of Velius' departure,
Erasmus’ attack of stone, and the two books mentioned as having appeared,
evidently quite recently. It may fairly be assumed, too, that if 1 52 3 were correct,
Erasmus would have mentioned also the Paraphrase on St. John (Ep. 1333).]

1266. 22. dissensionem] For details oi
this conflict between Town and Gown
see R. Stintzing, Zasius, 18 57, pp. 243‚4.

23. Velius] For his movements about
this time cf. Epp. 1252. 2n, 1267. 1—3.

periculo] H. Schreiber, Gesch. der
Unio. zu Freiburg), 1868, ii. 101,2‚ gives
instanees of the dan gers to which private
persons were exposed at this time.

2 5. Moguntiam] Of this proposal I
find no other trace.

1267. 1. Omatissime] To complete
this form of opening the introductor-y
s. P. is required; as in so many letters
printed from MSS. in vol. iii. For
publication a heading was usually
concocted out oi the addi-css, ending
in S. D.: S. P. was dropped, and the
pkpcpipgu title gttaixlied (to thcqworgs

of s. P., the title has boen left standing
alone—probably through an oversight ς
though the connexion would have been,
as not infrequently, rather abrupt.

2. consuetudo] For Velius‘ coming
see Epp. 1242,3 ; and cf. Ep. 1252. 211.

3. abitus] Velius was at Freiburg on
15 March, apparently with no intention
of leaving (MHE. iii. 51); but by
now, perhaps in consequence of his
recent experiences (Ep. 1266. 23), had
made up his mind to return castwards.
He writes from Vienna on 26 May
(BRE. 223); when he had been
some time returned, and had received
Ep. 1272 for transmission to Baslc.

A poem which he wrote describing
his Journey—Ad Erasmwm Rhotero-
damum Epistola, fo, Α6 in his Oratio
Dominica in versus adstricta, Vienna,
Singren, 1524—states (ll. 6-10) that hc
carried a letter from Erasmus, evidently
of about this date, to Reuchlin at
Tubingen ι
