through Rheinfelden and Schaffhausen (LB'. App. 346, 1732 Ε). Hgis departure

Hummelberg, who came over from Ravensburg to see him (Ep. 1316. 15), left

Constance on his return home on 18 Sept. (BRE. 226).

Erasmus gives the length

of his stay variously as ‘ ferme tres hebdomadas ' in Ep. 1342. 454, and ‘ mensem
totum’ in Ep. 1555. · but the earlier estimate is more likely to be correct, and is
supported by the statement of Beatus, who was his companion, that the visit

was made‘ mense Septembri’ (ΒΒΕ. 228).

town school, went in 1502 to Vienna,
where he was B.A. 1504, M.A. 1508.
He then taught in the Arts Faculty3

1516, Rector 1516— 17, and MD. 1517.

responded with a complimentary refer-
ence (added in 1526), citing Vadianus‘
note on Mela (1518, f. 59). 111 June
1518 (VE. 1273 cf. s.l 20) Vadianus
returned to Switzerland; where one of
his first acts was to visit Erasmus and
his circle at Basle (VE. 129 ; cf. Ep. 861.
5n). On settling at St. Gallen he was
appointed town physician3 member of
the town eouncil, in succession to 1113
father, 1520, and its head in 1526.
The rest of his life was spent there, as

its leading-citizen : and he directed the
introduction of the reformed religion,
with which, through Zwingli’s influence,
he was warmly in sympathy, though
with no tendency to extoemes. His ener-
gies were given to his municipal duties,
to medical practice, and to historica]
and geographical composition: his chief
work being a Chronicie of the Abbey of
St. Gallen, begun in 1529 and contain-
ing another eulogy of Erasmus, whom
he regarded as being, with Luther and
Zwingli, one of the leaders of reform
(see his Deutsche Historische Schriften,
ed. E. Gtstzinger, i, 1875, pp. 6-7‚ 469).
