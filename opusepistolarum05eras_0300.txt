[1523

Saluta mihi dominum Rectorem, cumque hoc omnes istius
Gymnasii proceres et alumnos. Scio quantopere debeam vniuersis.
Si non erit facultas referendae gratiae, certe non deerit opportunitas
testandi memorem animum. Christus optimus maximus tuam vene—
rabilem senectutem diu conseruet incolumem sanctis moribus et opti-
mis studiis. Bene vale, Basileae decimo calend. †Martii. Anno, 1523.

Erit et hoc humanitatis tuae, submonere literis, si quid videbitur
in quo putes me gratum facturum isti magistratui. Hoc quod
praestitit, erat supra meritum meum. Qui curauit vt ageretur de
nouo munere, fortasse fecit amieo amicus, mihi tamen parum rem
gratam fecit. Idem erat futurum Basileae, cum huc proxime
redirem; sed rc ex Bero cognita, manibus ac pedibus obstiti ne
quid fieret vltra vinaria xenia. Rursum vale.

[An original letter, in the same hand throughout: presumably autograph.
As there is some authority (cf. h. Delaruelle, G. Budd, p. 8911) for spelling the name
of the Dijon family of Morelet du Museau with an a, the writer is probably the
Morletus of Ep. 1370. 5. If so, this letter must be prior to Erasmus' of 1 April
<1523 ?>‚ in which he informed Budaeus that he was prepared to welcome the

from him, ‘ docteur es droits a Dijon ' is entered in the Archives communales of

A member of the family, possibly the same person, was nephew to the liberally
minded bishop of Meaux, William Briconnet (Ep. 1407. 118n)‚ and a pupi! of Nic.
Beraldus (Ep. 92 5) ; in 1 524 was chamberlain to Francis Ι, andin correspondence with
Oecolampadius, under the style ‘ Maurus Musaeus ² (Oec. E„ f. 176: Herminjard

until pardoned and recalled by Francis (ibid. 475—6, 478 ; cf. 1018 = VE. 1188);
