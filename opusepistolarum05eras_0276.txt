mirari industriam. In aetate tanta scribebat commentarios in
librum De senectute, aliosque nonnullos Tullii libellos. Licebat in
00 perspicere vestigia quaedam veteris seculi. Ibidem cognoui et
amaui Petrum Phedrum, lingua verius quam calamo celebrem:
erat mira in dicendo tum copia, tum autoritas. Magna felicitatis
pars est Romae innotuisse. Ille primum innotuit ex Senecae
tragoedia cui titulus Hippolytus, in qua repraesentauit personam
Phedrae, in area quae est ante palatium Cardinalis Raphaelis
Georgiam‘. Sic ex ipso Cardinale didici, vnde ct Phedro cognomen

additum. Is obiit minor annis, ni fallor, quinquaginta, dictus sui

seculi Cicero.
