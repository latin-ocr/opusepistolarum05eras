<f0. f5 w.) Hoc munusculum, Hieroslae nobilissime,—qu0d 11011
ante natum crat quam tibi dedicaretur, scd tua causa susceptum
est, vt esset quo vicissim nostri absentis commonefieres--, si tibi
probabitur, non grauaberis idem optimis fratribus 11118, Ioanni et

Stanislao, communicare.

Sin habes aliquid in hoc argumento

10 melius, sequere quod melius est : sed interim huic nostrae promptae
voluntati saltem hoc praemii rependes, vt quod habes melius, velis

nobis esse commune.

[A rough-draft by a secretam, in the volume of original papers at Dresden from
which come Ep. 1495 and others.. The text needs some correction. A date in
October may be conjectured : for Erasmus’ second letter of September—Ep. 1499,
which reached Duke George on 30 Oct.-has not yet arrived]

GEORGIVS DEI GRATIA DVX SAXONIAE, LANTGR &VIVS 'rHVRYNGIE
ET MAROHIO MYSNAE.

SALVTEM et fauorem, doctissime Erasme.

Accepimus literas

tuas vna cum collatione De libero arbitrio; et quoniam super
ea iuditium nostrum expectas, non possumus non ingenue fateri
quod admodum perplaceat, nec dubitamus quin in laudem et
sinerementum reipublicae Christianae perpetuum sit cessura.
Ceterum qualem apud diuersos fructum feret, nondum satis con-
stat; timemus enim quod aures obturauerint, nec velint vt aspis
incantantis vocem audire: et aiunt quoque nunc ab ipsis quasi

perfectam responsionem.

1502. 8. Ioanni] Asterwards the fa-
mous Reformer. In the summer of
¹524 he accompanied the embassy to
Blois‚ and then spent the winter in
France 3 whence he returnedin the spring
with two companions, Peter Lamy, the
Franciscan (Lond. xxvi. 4, LB. 1166)
and Anianus Burgonius of Orleans, to
dwell for some months in Erasmus'
house. See also Epp. 1593n, 1622. 4n.

9. Stanislao] The youngest of the
three brothers: mentioned also in
1, p. 33. 7—12. In Oct. 1514 he joined
his brothers at Bologna as a student;
see H. Dalton, Joh. a Lasco, 1881,
p. 59-60. On the present occasion he
went on with the embassy to France;
where he attracted the attention of
Francis 1, and remained at his court
till 1527. He aecompanied Francis to
the Italian campaign (cf. Ep. 1478. 10),
was taken prisoner with him at Pavia z
and when released as a Pole, followed
him to Madrid, whence he returned to

Sed salua res est, quod causae huius

1503. 6. diuersos scripsi:

France with Margaret of Valois (Acta
Tomiciana viii, p. 310). In July 1527
he accompam‘ed his brother Jerome on
his embassy to England (Brewer iv.
3231, 3265). On his return to Poland,
his uncle, the Abp. of Gnesen, attempted
to promote a marriage between him and
the young Duehess of Masovia (Acta
Tomicimm x, nos. 111, 198). Royal
opposition frustrated this, and he
married c. 1 5 31 Beata Odrowacz,
daughter of the Palatine of Russ1a, and
sister of his successful rival (La. Ε. 5411,
yon). In 1 5 30 he was at Constantinople
(T. Wierzbowski‚ Materyaly do Dziej.
Pism. Polsk„ i, 1900, 64). On return he
remained in retirement for some years 3
but succeeding his brother Jerome as
Palatine of Sieradz in 1543, 118 was
compelled to return to public life. In
1547 he attended the Diet of Au sburg
as Polish ambassador: see ierz-
bowski, op. cit„ 131 and Hos. E. vol. i.
