286 LETTERS OF ERASMU S [1523

which he wished to be adopted, ‘ Methodus verae Theologiac ex aeditione anni
1523 apud Michaelem Hillenium ' (1, p. 40. 29—30). The year-date of Hillen's
edition he corroborates earlier in the same Cataloqus (1, p. 21. 25—6). by adding the
words 'ac rursus anno proximo ’ to a statement that he had previously revised
and enlarged the Methodus (or Ratio) in 1522. T1=e dates of this preface may
therefore be regarded as adequately established.

But of an edition by Hillcn in 1523, or in any other year. no certain indication
has been found. Even the thnt bibliographcrs, after their far-reaching researehes,
have none to mention in BEr2. The earliest of this recension that they cite, is
a Cologne edition—no doubt only a reprint—by H. Alopecius‚ Dee. 1523 : which
contains at the end also a letter to some nuns at Cologne (Ep. 1346). They give,
however, another edition, s, I. et n.‚ containing the text revised and enlarged—
‘ postremum ab ipso autore castigata ct locupletata, cui exactior castigatio cum
noua elegantique praefatione <this letter> accessit’—together with Ep. 1346:
an item which is not mentioned on the title-page and which appears to have been
inserted for the purpose of filling the final sheet. This undated volume is in italic
type, closely resembling—especially in linked letters, i or u with s, u with m or n,
and many others—the italie Froben was using at that date, eg. in the second
issues of the Sponqia (Ep. 1389) and of the Cataloqus Iszccubrationum‚ and in the
Exomoloqesis (Ep. 1426). Of its five initial letters, cLNQS, some—in the actual
letters. though not in the backgrounds-are like the initials to be found in Bebel’s
books a little later. 1 have therefore adopted this undated edition as the archetype
for this preface and for Ep. 1346, conjecturing that it was printed for Hillen by
one of the Basle printers: an arrangement of which I know no other example,
but which has some corroboration in the insertion of Ep. 1346 as a supplement-
as would only have been easy if the book were being printed within reach of

Er'l'lffirleswas no other authorized issue of the Ratio verae Theoloyiae during Erasmus
lifetime. This prefaee was therefore not reprinted ; and is not even found in the
Basle Opera v‚·154o——probably because Hillen's edition had been so small tha-t there

was no copy then available at Basle.

Just at this time Archbishop Albert (Ep. 661 introd), under stress of the attacks
made upon him (see Ep. 1241 introd.)‚ was losing his liberal sympathies and ranging
himself with the Papal party: see P. Kalkoff, Capito, 1907, ch. 9.]

QVOD Paulus Apostolus non improbat quidem nuptias, verum
denunciat fore vt qui sese inuoluerint matrimonio, habituri sint
afflictionem iuxta carnem, videlicet eas sollicitudines subindicans
quas parentes sumere coguntur in gignendis, alendis, educandis,

5 elocandis prouehendisque liberis, mihi videtui· ad nos quoque perti-
nere, qui, tametsi corpore steriles, tamen subinde pro liberis aliquid
librorum gignimus; nisi quod nostra conditio videri potest haud
paulo durior. Siquidem illis nihil aliud denunciat Paulus quam
affiictionem carnis ; nos duplex sequitur afflictio, carnis et spiritus.

10 Neque enim haec facimus mediocri dispendio tum rei tum vale-
tudinis: quanquam haec quidem quota portio sunt, si ad animi
curas expendantur ? Proinde non solum hoc nomine miserior est
conditio· scribentium quam gignentium, quod duplici sarcina
granatur, verum quod in vtroque genere nostra praeponderant
ις incommoda. ⁷
Quanto facilius est mulieri concipere foetum quam nobis idoneum
