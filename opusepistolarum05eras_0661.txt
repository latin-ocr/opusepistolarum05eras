A DUBIOUS LETTER OF ERASMUS 619

letters mentioned is the well-known Cuspinianus os Vienna. The
party was dismissed on 29 April, at the end of the festivitieS, and
reached Vienna on 10 May. See the description of the ceremony
in AT. iv. 307-25, and ef. Ouspinianus' Taqebuch, ed. Th. G. von
Karajan in Fontes rerum Austriac„ script. 1, 1855, p. 410.

4. The words sititor, pluriuoco, famiqerabilis (ll. 18, 27, 39) are
rare and late ; and though they are 1101 impossible for Erasmus, I
cannot recall them elsewhere in his writings. The construction of
the letter is unusual also, and in many places loose.

5. ‘ Iacobus Philippus de Pellibus nigris Troianus ' is named in
J. Faceiolati’s Fasti qymnasz'i Patauini, 1757, ii. 120, 63 beginning
to teach in the school of Moral Philosophy, i. e. Arist. Eth„ in 1500.
Facciolati states further (ii. 121, iii. 313) 11161 1116 school was closed
by a deeree of the 8611616 011 29 June 1506, and only reopened
‘ triennio post ' by another teacher, who soon retired ‘ belli caussa ⁷ :
after which it rema-ined closed till 1518. Erasmus’, first, and perhaps
only, visit 1ο Padua began in December 1508: so that it seems
impossible for him 10 have been Pellenegra⁷s ⁶ in Summa praeceptor
ac condiscipulus ' (ll. 33-4).

6. Thomas Didymus (Ep. 302. 1311) 13 1101 credited with any
translations into the vernacular ε consequently 1116 1611161 illogical
comparison in 11. 36-8 10363 113 point.

7. The dates of time and place assigned are quite at variance with
what is known of Erasmus' movements. The year-date was perhaps
added by the printers to fit that of the book. The only year that
suits the wedding is 1518 ε and for this the month-date might be
corrected from M ar. to M ai. But though Erasmus was at Basle in
May of that year, he did not arrive till the 13111 (Epp. 847. 1, 848. 1),
after travelling direct from Louvain. For the years 1519—21 the
place-date must be sacrificed, since he was then at Louvain : but
even that change does not help, for there is no room in any of those
years for a journey 10 Poland before 1 March. In both 1522 and
1523 he was in Basle at that date z but again there is no room for
his journey, and moreover by then the wedding had faded away into
the past. By 1524 Ingold was dead.

With such inherent difficulties in the letter, it is not easy to
suppose that it is a mere forgery ; by some 0116 who had not skill
enough 10 make his work like its exemplar 01· 10 avoid evident
improbabilities. The book appeared, too, in Erasmus' lifetime : so
that it behovcd a sorger 1ο take pains. It should be noted, however,
that at the beginning of 1524 Erasmus’ death might well have been
expected: ef. Ep. 1408. 2-8. Α possibility that suggests itself is
that the letter was written in 1518, by some one who had just
returned from Cracow 3 and that later the print-ers, seeing its value
as commendation for the book, selected it for the pmiace, and,
thinking that Erasmus might be dead, inserted his 1161116 instead of
the writer's‚ in order to enhance the testimony, adding at the same
time false dates. The names of Ingold and Didymus perhaps
indicate that the writer was connected with Strasburg.
