studied at Louvain, and obtained, probably there, his licence in theology. He
attracted the notice 01 Adrian 01 Utrecht, and in 1515 went with him to Spain
as secretary3 winning his confidence completely and becoming his confessor.
For a few months in 1522 he was Adrian’s datary : but this position he was glad
to resign to Enckevoirt. His influence with the Pope continued, however (Ber-

June 1523. It was generally expected tha-t when Adrian created a Flemish
Cardinal, Hezius would be selected instead of Enckevoirt; but the Pope died
without making adequate provision for him. He remained at Rome for some time
after Adrian's death; and Ep. 1483, sending the De libero arbitrio, is probably
addressed to him there. But before 21 July 1525 he returned to the North, with
instructions from Clement vn to silence Erasmus’ opponents among the friars (see
Ep. 1589²²‚ and his report, 26 Oct„ in Balan, pp. 5 52-6o); and settled at hege,
where he held a canonry at St. Lambert's and after 1541 became Vice-dean. His

and under the influence 01 the Louvain theologians he came to regard his former
