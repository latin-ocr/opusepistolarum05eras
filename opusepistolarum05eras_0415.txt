In Latinis habes Vtrosque Siluios, Morellum

gymnasiareham, Bauenffium, Milonem. Theologos, certe qui sunt
nostrae farinae, reperias multos qui tua causa mortem oppetere non
detrectauerint. Reliqueram Brissotum doctorem medicum, philo-

 

mother to jein Calvin at Geneva. See
E. de Bude, Vie de Guillaume Bude,
1884, p. 297.

98. Siluios] Francis and J ames, third
and seventh children of Nic. Dubois,
a weaver of Amiens. Francis, well-
known as a scholar and principal of the
College of Toumay at Paris, appears as
a correspondent of Erasmus in 1525
(Ep. 1600). James (1478—13 Jan.

Greek, and Hebrew. But his interest
was in medicine, and like Rabelais and
Vesalius he paid much attention to
anatomy. He took his M.B. at Mont-
pellier 29 Nov. 1529, and M.D. 1530,
and then lectured with great success at
Paris. Besides many medical works
he composed In linquam Gallicam
lsaqwqe vua cum qrammatica Latino-
qallica, Paris, R. Stephanus, 7 Jan.
1531 : for which see a Stettin programm
by G. Huth, 1899. From 1550 till his
death he was Professor of Medicina in
the 0011080 de France. His avarice
made him the object of a lampeon,
Syluius ocreatus, which appeared 'm
Paris shortly after his death. See
a sketch, prefixed to a reprint of this, by
L. Thuasne in Rev. des BibliothequeS,
Aug. 1905 3 the life by R. Moreau, pre-
fixed to Sylvius’ Opera medv'ca, Geneva,
1630; and NBG.

Morellum] Theodericus Morellus
of Champagne was teaching at Paris
in the 0011080 de la Marche c. 1518,
when he edited Bapt. Mantuanus’
Eumol-ica for the use of his pupils
(Renouard‚ Badius, ii. 118). Some
verses to him are found in an edition of
Politian’s Ill. vir. Epistolae, Paris,
Badius, 1523 ; and P. Vidovaeus dedi-
cated to him an edition of Valla’s
Eleqantiae, July 1523 (ibid. iii. 185.
335). In 1542 he produced Euchiridion
ad verborum copiam, Paris, M. de Porta3
elzdnd he is also eredited with notes on

1vy.

99. Bauentium] A student at Paris,
111 the colleges of Harcourt and Lisieux ;
editor of a small volume of classica]
and modern Epiqrammata ex optimis
quibusque authoribus selecta, Paris,
J. Badius, sub Pascha 1523 (Renouard,
Badius, ii. 147). He perhaps came from
the village of Bavent, near Dives, in
N ormandy.

Milonem] Aemilius or Mileus
Perrotus of Paris was a fellow-student
there of P. Pithou ( 1497-15 54), father
of the scholar, and Chr. Thuanm.
father of the historian. He was a pupil
of Farel (l. 9211) 111 the 0011. Lemoine
(Herminjard 285), and in April 1524
was teaching grammar there (ibid. 98).
Later he taught at Toulouse3 but in
1529-30 was studying law at Turin
(ibid. 252, 267, 285), having halted
there on his way to Padua. He re·
mained in Italy for three years, resid-

Jac. d’Albret‚ bp. of Nevers, to Rome.
See numerous letters of P. Bunellus to
him, 1530—2, in Bun. E.

Aiter taking his LL.D. at Padua in
1532, he returned to France ; where he
published some commentaries on a sec-
tion of the Digest, Lyons, S. Gryphius,
1533, dedicated to Philip de Cosse,
a Benedictine and Bp. of Coutances
1530-48, to whom he was much
beholden- Later Francis 1 appointed
him a member of the Parliament of
Paris.

See P. J . Grosley, Vz'e de Paleou, 17 56,
i. 2-3, 11. 287—91 ; and A. Samouillan‚
De Petro Bunello, 1891, 3 5—42.

101. Brissotum] Perhaps Peter Bris-
sot, born at Fontenay 10 Comte in
Poitou in 1478, MJ). at Paris 27 May
1514. In medicine he revived the
teaching of Hippocrates and Galen
as against that of the Arabians. A
Disceptatio by him on a new mode of
letting blood, Paris, S. Colinaeus, 152 5
(published posthumously by a Portu-
guese pupil, Ant. Luceus of Evora, with
a preface 1 June 1525), aroused a con-
troversy which lasted for a generation ;
and despite the support of the Medica!
Faculty at Salamanea, his opponente
tried to quash his teaching by appealing
to Charles v. He was also interested
in botany, and went to Portugal in
1518 in tho hope of proceeding to
America to study the plants of the New
World. For some years he practised at
Evora.

The authority for his life is a sketch
by R. Moreau, prefixed to a Paris
edition of his Disceptatio, 1622. His
death is there dated 1522 flu. ς but the
mention here throws doubt on this. See
Zedler and N BG.
