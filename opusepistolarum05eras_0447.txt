1426. To FRANors MOLINIUS.

Exomologesis f0. A2. Basle.
Lond. xxix. 30: LB. v. 145. 24 February 1524.

which contains also several smaller pieces by Erasmus (see Epp. 1310, 1324, 1329,
1347, 1427, 1428 3 the latest dated 1 March). This treatise, which was begun in
Now 1523 (Ep. 1397. 14), was 111 the p1ess on 17 Feb. (VE. 380), and by 6 July
1524 had been presented to Molinius ‘ gemina lingua, Latina videlicet et Gallica,
concinnatum ’ (HerminJ'ard 103). It is mentioned also as already published in the
second edition 01 Cat. Luc„ Sept. 1524 (1, p. 20. 24-5). It is evident therefore that
the book was produced 101· the March fair at Frankfort z consequently the month-
date assigned conjecturally in vols. i. 611, ii. 1, needs revision. There are signs,
however, 01 two 2'states—e. g. on 10. Ε8 v0, in the title 01 Ep. 1329 some copies
have ADmANo, which in others 13 corrected : so it is possible that part of the edition
was strgck off in haste for the spring fair, and the rest finished at leisure 101·

The only authorized edition known to me between α and the Basle opera, 1540,
is a Froben issue of March 1530 ⁴ recognita diligenter et aucta' (β); 01 which

The Exomoloyesis was translated into French, perhaps even before publicat-ion,
by Cl. Cantiuncula as Μ anicre de se confesser, Basle, sac„ 26 April 1524, with a pre-
face to Margaret of Navarre, 26 March 1524. Another French version, Le vray

own work. An English translation, without name or date, appeared in London,
J. Bydell ; who was printing between 1534 and 1544. For an estimato 01 the book
among the Reformers see a letter 01 Farel, quoted by Herminjard (i, Ρ. 22411),
which speaks of ‘ insulsissimo et omnibus merdis concacando Confessionis libello ⁷.
Passages from it were attacked also from the orthodox side. Gilbert cognatus,
Erasmus’ servant at Freiburg, composed in later years an Apoloqeticus pro Erasmtca
Exomoloqesi ; of which Ι know no earlier issue than 111 Cognatus’ collected Opera,
Basle, H. Petri, 1562, 11. 83-8.

The second variant in the title indicates that the position 01 Μο11111113 (300
ΕΡ. 523. 711) 111 1113 300 was not so secure as Erasmus now supposed. Condom
is a small town in Gascony, sw. of Agen, with a handsome cathedral begun
in 1505 by Bp. John de Matre († 13 Oct. 1521). Some light is thrown on the
matter by the Journal (ed. S. Guichenon, in Hist. de la maison de Savoya
ii, 1660, pp. 459, 461, 463) 01 Louise of Savoy, whose protege Molinius seems to
have been. She cites his testimony as to the date 01 her own birth. His appoint-
ment, by 1501, as ‘ Maistre d’Escole ’ to Francis (born 12 Sept. 1494) was very
likely due to her ε 3110 records on 27 Ν ov. 1515 the gift to him of 200 crowns ‘ qui
furent bien employes, car il a bon vouloir de seruir ’ 3 on 8 Oct. 1519 that Francis
had made him Grand Almoner ‘ a ma requeste ’ς also that the see had been
promised to Molinius ⁵ a Amboise 011 ma presence ’ by Francis before ever he
became king, i. e. not later than 1514. 011 9 May 1520 101 the third time the
King renewed his promise, adding that he had that very morning refused the see
to another applicant. Finally on 17 Oct. 1521, only four days after the death
01 Bp. de Marre (101 311011 celerity cf. Ep. 623 introd.)‚ at 9 a.m., when Francis
was marchant en ordre de bataille ’ to relieve Valenciennes (01. Ep. 1302. 2511),
Μο11111113 preferred his own claim, and tho King at once acceded readily.

A rival appeared, however, chosen on 19 Oct. 1521 by the monks 01 St. Peter’s
at Condom, whose abbot had been created first bishop on the erection of the

Auch (GC. i. 1016), and since 1519 vicar-general to Bp. de Marre (GC. ii. 968).
At first it 300111οᾱ as 11 Molinius would succeed. On 17 J uly 1523 110 tendered 1113
obedience 101 the temporalities of Condom (Actes de Franeois Iffl', vii, 1896, p. 1 15);
and on 4 Dec. 1 52 3 a royal letter confirmed him in possession (GC. ii. animadv„
p. xlv). Nevertheless Grossoles prevailed and held the see until his death in
1544 ; completing in 1531 the cathedr-al bcgun by his predecessor. Why Molinius,
