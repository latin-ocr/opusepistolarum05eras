46 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1522

15 praelis Frobenianis excuduntur; contempsissem et alias causas

quasdam haud quaquam contemnendas.

Sed in primis terrebat

me iter, nunc solito magis infame latrociniis. Iam crebro feliciter
transcurri. Quod si quid accideret, actum esset de Erasmo.

De praefatione ac Paraphrasi quod tam amanter admones, summam
20 habeo gratiam. Praefationem neglectim adieci, in gratiam typo-
graphi; qui querebatur vacaturas aliquot pagellas, ni adiecissem
aliquid nugarum. Qualis qualis tamen est, meus est foetus vel, si
mauis, aborsus. Non oportet sic execrari haeresim vllam vt huius
odio non ausimus ad monere quae recta sunt. Neque enim Hierony-

damnarint nupt-ias ;

25 mus ideo veretur efferre laudibus virginitatem, quod Marcionitae
nec ideo non suadet monogamiam,

quod

digamiam damnarit Tertullianus. Si periculum est Euangelia vulgo
legi, quur in vulgat-issima lingua prodiderunt Apostoli ⁶? Nee arbitror
quicquam esse periculi, si laici sic legant sacros libros quemad-

30 modum illic praescribo. Quid Lutherus doceat nescio ; Paraphrasim

in Matthaeum magis ex autoritate Matthaei Cardinalis Sedunensis
suscepi quam ex meo iudicio t quod in praefatione non dissimulo.
In Apostolicis Epistolis si tuo iudicio magis satisfacio, argumentum

in causa est potius quam ego.

11n. Besides the works mentioned
there, Erasmus composed just at this
time an Epistola apoloqetica de inter-
dicto esu carniwn deque similibus
hominum constitutionibus, addressed to
the Bp. of Basle (Ep. 598) 21 April, and
printed by Froben, with another Apo-
loqia (see Ep. 1277. 2211), 6 Aug. 1522.
It is of interest as containing a few
practical proposals for reform, which
in view of the hostility they were sure
to arouse from the orthodox, evince
some courage: (1)“ fewer saints’ days
(cf. Ep. 1039. 180-93), (2) liberty to
priests to marry, (3) greater freedom
in the matter of cating and fasting
(cf. Ep. 916. 143—8, 244—54). But
at the same time he wished to safe-
guard the authority of the bishops.
The Epistola was quickly circulated
in ms.: a copy reached Botzheim at
Constance early in July (VE. 317). In
Ep. 1581, and in some scholia added to
the Epistola in a Froben edition of 1532,
p. 132, but not reprinted in his collected
Opera, Erasmus states that he published
it at the Bishop's request. after it had
been carefully examined by L. Ber:
in 1, p. 33. 33-9 he represents the sug-
gestion as coming from the University.
He was moved to write it by a defiant
eating of pork in a private house not
far fromEhis own (cf. Ep. 1353. 177-8),
without any attempt at concealment,
on Palm Sunday, 13J‘2‘April 1522, by
a company which included Herm.
Busch and a certain Sigismund Stein-

In metaphrasi sensus bona fide

schnyder‚ a surgcon of great skill.
Steinsehnyder's utterances on many
subjeets had been rash (cf. Ep. 1496);
and Erasmus wishing to defend him
and himself, as his own name had
been mentioned in the affair, addressed
the Bishop ‚on the general question.
See Zw. ΕΞ. 204, 206, with Egli’s notes ;
the scholia of 1532, pp. 13o-1 ; Basler
Chroniken, i (1872), pp. 36—7‚ 383—4;
and ef. VE. 308. The ferment aroused
by the episode continued throughout the
summer ; and both the Bp. and theTown-
Couneil issued mandates forbidding
such licence, and also enJ'oining upon
all preachers that they must be careful
to teach nothing but the Scriptures:
see CPR. pp. 88,9‚ and Am. E. 14.

Erasmus’ appeal on behalf of Stein-
schnyder availed for a time; but
⁴ anno sequenti post Inuocauit (22 Feb.
1523) propter suas blasphemias in
sacramenta Ecclesiae et Mariam vir-
ginem, ac proditionem quam in Alsatia
moliebatur, apud Ensishemium quadra-
tus est’ (Narratio of the Carthusian‚
Geo. Carpentarius of Brugg, in Baslcr
Chron. i. 384). Erasmus' scholia give
full details of the execution.
