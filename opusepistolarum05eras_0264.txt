132013451350 To HERMAN LETHMATIUS.
&ouda Ms. 9 59. Basie.
LB. App. 321. 21 February 1523.

[An original letter, autograph throughout, except the address, which is by
a secretary: one of a small collection of letters written to Herm. Lethmatius
which arc now in the Town Library at Gouda, all but one of them (Ep. 1359)
autograph. The Library reeords show that they were given to the Library of
St. John'S, the Groote Kerk, at Gouda (out of which the present Town Library
grew) by Henry Lethmatius, great-grandson of Herman’s brother, 111 1653—a date
which dissociatos them from the Gouda MSS. of vol. i, p. 013.

It appears from Ep. 1383. 17—21 that this letter was being cireulated in print
in Aug. 15233 but no copy of 311011 an issue seems to exist. Erasmus, for an
evident reason (ll. 43-4), never included it among his published letters3 and the
first known print of it is in Th. J. ab Almeloveen’s Amoenz'tates tlceoloqico—
plce'loloyicaa Amsterdam, 1604, p. 62*not an accurate text.

The MS. has suffered much, part of it being badly faded and the paper decayed,
perhaps through water3 and the right-hand edge of the recto being for the most
part worn away. Also, while it was in 1113 possession, Henry Lethmatius pasted
over some part of the verso with Paper, on to which he transcribed the lines
(38—45) thus covered. For these reasons the text is often difficult to decipher;
and in the lines covered only a few of the words can be read through the adherent
paper. But with the help of a copy which he made with his own hand (cf. his
inscription in J. Fisher's Assertionzts Lutlzeranae Constantio, Antwerp, M. Hillen,
1523, also presented by him to 1110 Library: 274, Ε. v. 68), most of the gaps
can be reeonstructed with certainty. For the year-date he has in each case—on
the MS. and in his copy—1522. It seems likely that the final figure was legible
to him, and therefore correctly transcribed. If so, the interpretation to be put
upon it is shown by the mention of Adrian's Brief (Ep. 1324).

Besides the Gouda MS. there are ms. copies of this letter in the University
Libraries of Basle (Amorbachiana) and Leiden (no. 51), and the Royal Libraries at
Brussels (Gseldenhauer's collectanea) and Munieh (Cam. 33, f. 173); but as the
original letter exists, they have little importance. Some of them may have been
made from the printed text. All agree in giving the year-date 1 522. The remaining
letters in Lethmatius' collection are printed by Almeloveen, pp. 65—93: see also
I. W<alvis‘> Beschryv. d. Stad Gouda, 1714, p. 218.

Dr. J. Prinsen in editing Geldenhauer's Collectanea, 1901, p. 14811, and con—
sidering only the copy there, suggested that this letter might be in part a forgery.
But as Dr. L. A. Kesper shows in De Nederlandsche Spectator, no. 34, 1904, the
existence of the autograph original entirely dissipates this opinion]

S. P. Hilarium iam dicaram tuo Moecenati priusquam tuae
litterae huc vocarunt. Primum destinaram Regi Galliarum3 sed
dehortantibus licet amicis, verti consilium ob hos rerum tumultus
omnibus bonis studiis inimicissimos: quorum ego nullum video

5 finem nisi si quis exoriatur ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός. Proinde magis tibi
gratularer aulam, si tempora essent tranquilliora. Tui vero candoris
est quod mihi gratias agis, imo tu teipsum ornas tuis istis eximiis
virtutibus; quibus, vti confido, vicissim ornabis Christum, cui
debentur omnia. Videris enim mihi multis nominibus felicissimus,

expediuisset. Verum quia Spiegel non venit, litt-eras tuas ad illum tibi remitto:
cum enim principes omnes abeunt, illum minime venturum arbitror β
