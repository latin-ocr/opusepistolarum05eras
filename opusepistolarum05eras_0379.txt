1392] FROM EN NIO FILONARDI 343

tumultum consilia interea mihi aperire, quae iam scribit praefatae
sanctissimae me<moriae> Adriani vi significasse, vel reuocer vel
permaneam, omnia futuro Pontifici vnanimiter insinuarem, et nihil
omitterem quod ad eiusdem glorie augumentum fore cognoscerem ;
cui certe tantum afficior, vt occasionem desiderem qua eidem non
vulgariter obsequi valeam, eique ad vitam Vsque teneri fateor, et
omne, quod in me ipsum, incrementum ilii cuperem.

In negocio autem domini Io. Frobenii doleo vehementer talem
non esse mihi facultatem, vt alias pro quodam monacho respondi.
Quae si esset, R. D. non semel experta nouit me eidem nihil posse
negare, cum eadem apud me etiam impossibilia queat3 cui toto
corde me offero atque commendo vt foeliciss<ime> diu viuat.

Nox: 1533 ; and an octavo 01 Aug. 1535 (7). Those 01 1523 and 1524 mentioned
in BErl. I have not been able to see. The book at once became popular, and was
translated into many languages: German, Strasburg, M. Flach, 1523; French,

Jostus Ludovicus Decius (c. 148 5—26 Dec. 1545) was a native 01 Weissenburg

Of his educat-ion nothing is known. By the age of 14 he had migrated to Moravia ;
and in Sept. 1507 was at Schwaz on the Inn, perhaps learning mining. Thence hc
