[A reply to Ep. 1277 ε evidently written in response to the opportunity offered
by Vives in Ep. 1306. 37. It reached Vergara at Alcala : see his letter to
Stufflca, 7 May 152 3. For that and for this manuscript, which is an xviiic copy,

see App. 15 in vol. iv.]

St. John's College, Canibridge; see
Τ. Baker’s History, ed. J. Ε. B. Mayor,
1869, i, pp. 281,2. After that nothing
is certainly known of him until the
present mention: but at some period
he was in Paris, and he also visited
Bavaria, where he learnt from the
Austin friat, Caspar Amon or Am-
monius (for whom see BN), perhaps at
Lauingen on the Danube (cf. GPR.
p. 76 and LE2. 582).

111 July 1522 he appears to have re-
turned from England to Louvain (ΕΗΒ.
xxii. 749). Later in the summer he was at
Hagenau negotiating with Anshelm (Ep.
397) to printsome ofhjs books. This ledto
an invitation from Tubingen to succeed
Reuchlin († 30 June), which he readily

in 1 52 3 Henry appointed him to 103011
Hebrew in Cambridge; and in spite
of letters from F erdinand and Tubingen
University pleading for delay, and
alleging that Wakeseld’s pupils thought
more of him than 01 Reuehlin, he was
back in Cambridge by March 1524.
He was made chaplain to the King3
and proceeded B.D. 1524—5. An
Oratio de laudibus trium linguarum,
delivered in Cambridge 1524, was
printed by W. de VVorde, London‚ 8.(1.
111 1527 Henry consulted him with
Pace about the Divorce. Wakefeld

at first supported the Queen; but fur-
ther evidence changed his mind, and he
engaged in controversy with F isher, to
whose patronage he owed much: sec
his S yntaqma de Hebraeorum codicum in-
corruptimae, London‚ W. de Worde, s. α.,
and Kotser codicis, <London>, T. Ber-
thelet, <0. 15 35). As a reward Henry
sent him to teach at Oxsord; and his
success induced the University to peti·
tion to have him permanently. In
May 1532 he was incorporated B.D.‚
with a canonry in the King's new col-
lege : one of his public lectures there is
printed with the Syntaqma. His writ-
ingS, which include a Paraphrase on
Ecclesiastes, show critical ability, com-
bined with much vanity and sels-
assertion. See DN B and Cambridye
Grace-Books ΒΞ, F.

The permission quoted there from
Fisher to ' master Wakteld ³ to study
Hebrew abroad, appears to belong 10

Era-smus celebrated him with the
Apotheosis Oapniom's, suggested to him
by a conversation with Conr. Pellican
(CPR. p. 79), and first printed in the
new Froben edition of the Colloq.
