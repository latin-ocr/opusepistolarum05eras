in 1510, to England in 1512, 1514, 1521. In 1511 he was appointed chaplain and
almoner to Prince Charles (Julius Chjfietius, Aula sacra principum Belgyii, 1650,

capacity and fidelity: see Gachard in Compte-rendu des 36611666 cle la commission
royale d’histoire, Brussels, x (1845), pp. 19, 20, 32. About ι111157 1516 (Brewer ii. 2166 ;
61. Mart. E. 576) he received the see of Badajoz, following Manrique3 and he
accompanied Charles to Spain in Sept. 1517 (Gachard iii. 47). Before June 1520
(Brewer 111. 866) he was translated to Palencia3 in Sept. 1521 Leo x promised
to make 111111 cardinal (ibid. 1601) ; and just now there was talk 01 1116 supplanting
Philibert Naturel (Ep. 178. 42n) as Chancellor 01 the Golden Fleece (de Reiffen·
berg, p. 356). In the summer 01 1522 116 again went with Charles to Spain; and
was in hopes 01 receiving the vacant archbishopric 01 Toledo (Quintanillzn Archetypo
de virtuales ·. . . F. X imencz de adsueras, 1653, p. 258). His power at that time is
shown by conversations reported by the Venetian ambassador in England (Brown
iii. 447, 465). Shortly after Charles landed at Santander, de la Mota fell ill
(6. 28 J uly z Gachard ii. 66), and had to be left behind He lingered 101· 601116 weeks
at Reynosa; but the news 01 his death reached Valladolid on·20 Sept. : see the
letters 01 Martin de Salinas, printed by A. Rodriguez Villa in Boletin dc la real acad.
cle la hist„ Madrid, xliii (1903), pp. 11, 16, 40, 48, 50, 54.

George Sauromanus (Ep. 1342. 32311) dedicated to him Hispaniae Consolatio,
s.l. et a., condoling with Spain on its king⁷s return to the Netherlands; with
a preface dated Aug. 1520, Louvain. See also Bcrgenroth ; Henne ; Le Glay.
⁷ In the interval between Epp. 1268 and 1273 may be placed Erasmus' visit to
Schlettstadt, which is described in Epp. 1 302 and 1342. 300 seq . (61. Ep. 1285. 3-4, 8).
His purpose was to journey to Brabant and pay his court before the Emperor's
departure to Spain (cf. Ep. 1269. 11n) : also to arrange in person, as he had been
advised (Ep. 1254. 20-1)‚ for the payments 01 1116 two pensions (Epp. 1245, 1273.
4411). Travelling down the Rhine he stopped two days with Gallinarius at Breisach
(cf. Ep. 1307. 111) to rest, and then struggled on to Schlettstadt, where for four days
he was the guest 01 Beatus Rhenanus. But it was now evident that he was unequal
to the fatiguc 01 60 long ajourney, especially in a sudden burst 01 warm spring weather.
So he turned round, and after resting again with Gallinarius, made his way back
to Basle: whence he dispatched Hilary Bertulphus c. 23 April with a packet 01
letters (Epp. 1273—6, and no doubt many others: 61. Ep. 1281. 23—5‚ 81-2) to carry
the adieux (cf. Ep. 1302. 48) 116 had thought it proper to make, 11 possible, in person.
Epp. 1275. 74-5, 1276. 4, 1281. 25-7 show that he did not altogether abandon the
design 01 making the journey, even after his return: which is an indication 01
the importance he attached to the fulfilment 01 1116 court obligations]

REVERENDE Praesul, quod apud Caesarem tuae vocis testimonio
tam candide et defenderis et ornaris Erasmum‚ hoc mihi fuit gratius,
quod et praeter spem obtigit et meritum. Sed interim nostra qui
libros aodimus, nihilo melior est conditio quam olim fuit histrionum,
qui in prosceniis fabulam agebant populo. Illis erat ediscenda 5
fabula, meditanda actio, nihil non faciendum, vti theatro satisface-
rent : populo, inquam, illi promiscue, vere beluae multorum capitum,
in quo paucis cadem placent, nce iisdem semper eadem ; denique
euius magna pars studio potiusquam iudicio ducitur. Ab horum
pollice pendet miser ille saltator ; adorat plebeculam, et quum nihil 10
non fecerit, felix sibi videtur si impetrauit vt stet fabula. Quod si
exsibilatur, arbor quaerenda suspendio. Sane de libris nec minus
varia nec minus morosa iudicia, nec minus corrupta studiis. Hoc
nomine nostra sors iniquior, quod hacc damus nostro sumptu, quum
histrionibus sua fuerit merces. Et illi, si non succedat saltatio, 15
tantum ridiculi sunt ε 1106, 61 displicemus, haeretici.

Mihi sane studio fuit non tam placere quam prodesse omnibus. Et
