[The difficulty of this letter is pointed out in Ep. 447. 596n. In view of Ep. 1415.
14 and of such indications as that Schinner's death was reported to Vadianus

from Rome on 13 Oct. 1522 (VE. 325), it seems to me now impossible to suppose
that in J an. 1524 Erasmus can still have been ignorant that the Cardinal of Sion
was dead. The heading is therefore inconsistent, with the dates of time.

On the other hand, if we consider the close verbal connexion with Epp. 1411,
1418, 1428, and the identity of the articles mentioned in the second paragraph
here with some of those defended in the Apoloqia to which Ep. 1428 is the prefaoe,
there can be no hesitation in ascribing the major part of this letter to Jan.. 1524 :
so that it must be addressed to some one else than Schinner. The only portion
which is in accord with the heading is the passage bracketed at the end. That
agrees completely with the offer from Schinner which Erasmus mentions repeatedly
in the summer of 1522 (cf. Ep. 1299. 45n) ; and therefore, in the absence of any
trace of so definite and liberal an invitation from any other of Erasmus' friends at
Rome, I have printed the passage separately as Ep. 1295.

The main portion of the letter, which obviously is written to Rome, is very
probably addressed to Campegio. The dates of mouth and year agree completely
with those of Ep. 141 1, also sent to Rome 3 and as the two letters are separated
by many pages in the Opus E'pistolarum (H), there 18 110 reason to suppose
that either of them has infected the other. Epp. 1415. 2-4, 1423. 5-10 show that
about this date, in the stress of his 11111088, Erasmus sent a letter to Campegio,
not written by himself but dictated to a secretary (cf. Ep. 1412. 55, also written
to Rome) ; answering an invitation from the new Pope (ef. Epp. 1408. 10,
1409. 5), conveyed through Campegio‚ to come at once to Rome (cf. 11. 7—12 here).

For the conflation of the two letters it is not difficult to frame a supposition.
If Erasmus had begun Ep. 1295 with a heading and only a few lines, it would have
been quite in accordance with the care shown in those days to save paper and to
treasure things written, that the sheet should have been at hand eighteen months
later among his files, and that the secretary to whom he was dictating should have
used it to take down in the rough what was no doubt so hastily uttered as to
necessitate a fair copy being made for dispatch. The editors of H, finding the sheet
with heading and dates, the second part being evidently written to Rome, may have
combined them together, treating the line or two in Erasmus' handwriting as
a postscript to be inserted at the end. That the inconsistency of the dates and the
heading should have been overlooked, is not surprising, if, as is most likely, Erasmus
did not correct the proofs.

For similar cases of conflation see Epp. 1 19 and 128, Epp. 890 and 891.]
