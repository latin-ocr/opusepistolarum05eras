144 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1522

intimate with Erasmus, it may be conjectured that the Gouda text was derived
from the original document actually received at Basle: so that, with some
allowance for the occasional inaccuracy of Hand A, it may be adopted here (a).
A year or so after the arrival of the Brief, Erasmus had it printed in the Exo-
moloqesis (βε sec Ep. 1310 introd.); and thereafter it appeared, with only
two trifling variations, in the collected volumes of letters. In the Deventer
MS. 99, ff. 7, 8 there is a contemporary copy—as far as peniteat (l. 120) ; perhaps
incomplete through the loss of a leaf—by the same hand as wrote Epp. 296, 12 58 ; but
its variants, apart from a few sporadic errors, show that it was made from Β. So
too with contemporary copies at the Hague (131. O. 31), and among Cranevelt’s
papers at Louvain (see p. 83), and with a copy by an unknown hand in Gelden-
haucr's collectanea at Brussels, ed. J. Prinscn, 1901, pp. 133—7. These four
mss. may therefore be neglected here. But besides them there is a much fuller
draft of the text in a ΜΞ. at the Vatican (Lat. 3917), which contains a number of
contemporary copies of papal documents by various secretaria} hands. For this
letter, which is on ff. 16, 17, there aro some corrections by a hand which resembles
Aleander’s3 and thc MS. therefore supports his statement made in a letter to
Erasmus, 1 April 1532 (see Paquier in the Mdanqes of the Ecole Francaise de
Rome, xv, 1895, pp. 365‚6): ‘Breue illud ad te Adriani Pontificis, quod aureum
vocas, quo tantopere gloriaris, quod contra aduersarios toties obiieis, si nescis,
mea foetura fuit; idque eo tempore quo tam male de me mereri non cessabas ;
extatque etiamnum apud me archetypon multo laudum tuarum plenius et
locupletius quam ad te missum fuerit ’—a claim which suggests that Adrian,
being dissatisfied with Hezius’ first draft, as not warm enough (Ep. 1342. 632-41)‚
may have dictated the substance of what he wished to say (cf. Epp. 1341. 27-9,
1345. 15—17) to both Hezius and Aleander, for each to indite a suitable invitation
to Erasmus; Hezius’ second attempt, which has several resemblanccs to Ep.
13 39, being finally accepted. It is not necessary to reproduce all the
variations of Alcander's text, which at the points of contaet agrees with
β rather than α; but the more striking passages arc given in a separate
a aratus

ΡΓῘ1“)110 importance of this Brief to Erasinus was great. The new Pope was an old
friend (cf. Ep. 1304. Sn), and since bccoming Cardinal in 1517, though not specially
interested in the Renaissance (cf. Ep. 1166. 10511), had given encouragement to
Erasmus' recent studies; inviting him to continue upon the Old Testament the
methods he had applied to the New (Ep. 15813 cf. Apol. adu. debacchationes
Satoris, LB. ix. 75 3 F), and urging Leo to bring the famous scholar to
Rome (cf. Epi 1161. 22n)—though hints of disapproval had not been wanting
(cf. Ep. 1225. 111). But nearly a year had elapsed now since Adrian’s election,
and no sign had come of his sentiments towards Erasmus; in spite of feelers
extended through Barbirius (Epp. 1294, 1302) and direct approach with a dedica·
tion and its accompanying letter (Epp. 1304, 1310). The advanced party among
the reformers began to declare that Adrian was dissatisfied with Arnobiu83 and
that yielding to the pressure of the orthodox, such as Stunica and Canama, he
had pronounced Erasmus to be a heretic (Zw. ΕΖ. 246, 2 Nov. 1522, quoted in
Ep. 1327. 611 ; cf. VE. s.³ 96), and had publicly condemned his books (Ep. 1518 3
cf. Ep. 1342. 626-7). So that Erasmus had reason to be apprehensive. It is not
clear how soon his anxiety was relieved. The words prefixed to Ep. 1329 in the
Exomoloyesz's show that by 22 Dec. this Brief had not been delivered; and Epp.
1330. 47—9‚ 1331. 40—7, eonvey the same impression. On 27 Dec. Dorp at
Louvain knew of the invitation to Rome and ample promises accompanying it
(see his letter to Lethmatius in Th. J. Almeloveen's Amoen. tlzeol.-philoloqicae‚
1694, p. 68), the nature of which is revealed by Ep. 1345. 17-18; but the Brief was
sent to Brabant before it reached Erasmus at Basle (Ep. 1518). That he mentions
it in Ep. 1341 but not in Ep. 1337 implies that he did not see it till between 8 and
28 J an. In spite of the conditions that would evidently attach themselves to such
an invitation, if accepted, Erasmus welcomed it with joy (see Epp. 1341, 1345 ;
and cf. Ep. 1351. 1 1-13, 44—6) ; eagerly accepting the statement that Adrian had
dictated the greater part of it himself. The strength of his feeling is shown in the
letter from Aleander quoted above. Opinion at Rome is indicated in a letter from
Hannibal, the English Ambassad0r‚ to W olsey 13 Dec. 1522 (Brewer iii. 2714):
‘ His Holiness has sent for Erasmus under a fair colour by his Brief 3 and if he come
not, I think the Pope will not be content ². For Erasmus’ relations with Adrian
