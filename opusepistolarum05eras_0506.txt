470 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1524
menses aliquot car-ueram, posteaquam desieram vesci pyris assis
sed, vt hic sunt, syluestribus. Quidam putant fusionem felicius
euenturam‚ si Cyprio aeri misceatur stannum, ex quali materia
funduntur campanae. Est et aliud remedium, si caput Termini
vertatur ad latus. Nunc vtrinque respondens densitas facit vt
vultus minus foeliciter reddatur. Est insuper et ars contrahendi
imaginem ; sed longum id est et laboriosum. Si excipiatur argilla
incluso circulo aereo, deinde siccescat, idque fiat saepius, tandem
ex argilla excipiatur plumbea. Id commodius fieret, si haberetis
fontem. Is est in plumbo, sed apud artificem: quamquam is

pollicitus est se mihi illum redditurum. Nam habuit ex me supra

triginta florenos operae suae pretium.
Tantum idem habuit pro pictura. Et rursus nuper misi in Angliam
Erasmum bis pictum ab artifice satis eleganti. Is me detulit pictum

in Galliam.

xxi. 10, LB. 933). See also Epp. 1456,
1466, 1484, 1488.

28. pyris assis] For the use of dried
fruit in diet cf. a passage in thc
Eodesiastes (LB. v. 816 Ε), praising
monks who live sparingly and observo
their rule: ⁵ Pomum assum illis
Paschales sunt deliciae ². A sermon
recounted in one of Bebel’s Facetiae,
Paris, Nic. de Pratis, July 1516,
f0. B v0, describes the love of God as
‘ dulcis, sicut iusculum torridorum
pirorum ; solent enim agrestes homines
siluestria pira torrere et reseruare ad
ieiunium quadragesimale, et postea
liquefacere aqua. Vnde iusculum satis
dulce conficitur ¹.

30. Cyprio aeri] For the use of this in
classical times there are abundant
references in the Thesaurus.

31. eaput- Termini] See Ep. 1408. 29n.

40. in Angliam] For these two por-
traits cf. a passage in Beatus Rhenanus'
I η Ο. Plinium, ‘ post omnium aeditiones
annotationesque quas ad hoc tempus,
nempe annum M.D.xxv, videre con-
tigit ², Basle, Froben, March 1526,
pp. 29, 30, where among famous con-
temporary painters is mentioned ⁵ apud
Rauricos Ioannes Holbeinus‚ Augustae
Vindelicorum quidem natus verum
iamdiu Basiliensis ciuis, qui Erasmum
nostrum Roterodamum anno superiori
111 duabus tabulis bis pinxit felicissime
ot cum multa gratia, quae postea sunt
in Britanniam transmissae ’. One of
them was a present to Warham; see
Ep. 1488. 1-2.

It is commonly accepted that they
may be identified with those now in the
Louvre, and iu the Radnor collection
at Longford. The former can be dated

si qua pax affulserit,

1 523, because Erasmus is shown writing
his Paraphrase on St. Mark (Ep. 1400)
—-in the Basle study (l. 42n) the writing
is more legible ; the latter has the date
MDxxm on one of the books (see the
Radnor catalogue, 1909).

The Louvre pertrait was at one time
the property of Charles 1, who exchanged
it with Louis xin for a St. John Baptist
by Leon. da Vinci ; and a label on the
back shows that before Charles it
belonged to his tutor, Sir Adam
Newton († 163οε see DNB)‚ who had
been tutor to his elder brother, Princc
Henry, also. The Longford pertrait
was bought at Dr. Rich. Mead’s sale
in 1755 ; in the catalogue of which it
was stated to have come from the
Arundel collection. It is therefore
supposed to be the ‘Erasmus as big
as the life, by Holbein ’‚ which Evelyn
saw in Mr. Howard's house at Albury,
10 Aug. 165 5.

See the works on Holbein by A. Wolt-
mann, 1866-8‚ vol. 2, ch. 53 G. S.
Davum, 1903, p. 111 ; and A. B.
Chamberlain, 1913, i. 168-73.

42. in Galliam] Woltmann suggests
that this is the study now in Basle,
which is considered to have been made
for the Louvre portrait; and further
conjectures that as it came to the Basle
Museum from the Amerbach collection,
it was perhaps sent as a present to
Boniface, who was at Avignon in
1 2 3-4.

5 sacerdotium] The treasurership
at Tours : see Ep. 1434. 19¹1·

43. vinum] His supply of Burgundy
wine (cf. Ep. 1316. 24n) had run out;
but before the end of the summer it
was renewed (Ep. 1484).
