1274] TO LOUIS CORONEL 45

and his brother’s numerous books ; and to John Major’s Opera, Paris, J. Barbier,
20 June 1 06.

Τ110 brosthers were still in Paris in 1517 (VE. 92); but L. Marineus, Dc rebus
Hispaniae, Alcala, M. de Eguia, J uly 1530, f. 167, in a notice of them (withdrawn
with the rest of the section de viris illustribus in the edition of May 1533), states
that when Oharles, as Emperor, went to Germany <in 1520), he summoned them to
him as councillors and court preachers, and that they became confessore to many οἱ
1118 nobles. Between 15 Dec. 1521 and 8 May 1522yL0uis was frequently employed
by Hulst (Ep. 1345. 39n) to assist in the work of the Inquisition at Bruss 018;
and then till3 June at Ghent, Bruges, and Antwerp (Fredericq v 263). He was
thus by now 3 person of importance (cf. Ep. 1281. 31— 3, 41- 54 )‚ and was perhaps
already secretary to Alfonso Maurique, bp. of Cordova and Chaffrles’ grand chaplain
(cf. Brewer iii, pp. 968,9) : 3 position which hc is known to have held later when
Manrique became Abp. of Seville (cf. two letters from him to A. Valdes, printed
by Oaballero, pp. 329—31 ; and the preface to Vives’ De Pacificatione, Antwerp,
M. Hfflen, 1529). Bergenroth (iii. 1. 426) mentions ecclesiastical provision ior
him in 1526, in the abbey of San Isidro at Leon. In 1525 (Ep. 1581) and again
1ῗέξέζὲ ’11ἒὲ110ξὲῗέῑῖἓί {3⁹32 {cimissffnss ¹2} 1at23⁰¹223¹ ἰζῖἓὲὲῗῗῃὲ, Ξΐὲἓέἒὶιῖἒῗρῗοῗ
By Diego Gssaoian of Alderete, who renewed acquaintance with him at Burgos
in Oct. 1527, he was considered the first theologian in Spain (Alva MS„ Madrid‚
ff. 7 v0, 13 v0). He was still living in the early part of 1530 (Lond. xxv. 25,
LB. 1104); but when Marineus wrote, he was perhaps dead.

A letter to him from Ant. Guevara, 8 May 1 52 3 Medina del Campo, is included
in the latter' s Epistolas familiares, Antwerp, 1562, i, ff. 201‚2; and another from
Alf. Femandez, Archdeacon of Alcor, 10 Sept. <152 6), Palencia, about an attack
on a Spanish version of Erasmus’ Emkiridion‚ is printed by E. Boehmer from
the Burscher collection at Leipzig, in Jb. s. romanische u. enqlische Liternum, iv
(1862), pp. 159—61.

ERASMVS ROT. LODOVICO GORONELLO S. D.

VIR eximie, Lodouicus Viues mihi tuas virtutes obiter denarrans
nonnihil accenderat animum meum cupiditate amicitiae tecum
ineundae, · sed hanc scintillam Lodouicus Berus vehementer exci-
tauit, plenis, vt aiunt, tibiis magnoque affectu depingens mihi felix
istud ingenium tuum, non solum in litteris theologicis absolutum,
verum etiam in disciplinis mathematicis eleganter excultum. Nunc
vero rarus quidam animi tui candor et erga me nihili hominem
studium plane Christianum ex Guidonis Morilloni litteris cognitum
ac perspectum fuit ; vt maiorem in modum doleam me mihi talem
amicum ante profectionem meam non aliquo saltem pacto conciliasse.
Gestiebat animus isthuc aduolare ante Caesaris profectionem. Con-
tempsissem valetudinem sic crebris morbis nuper afflictam vt
aegre vitam sustineam ; contempsissem itineris magnitudinem ;
neglexissem studiorum labores qui nunc in manibus meis sunt ac
