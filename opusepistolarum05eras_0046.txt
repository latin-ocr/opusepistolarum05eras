S„ vir ornatissime. Huc me contuleram, vt adessem meis
lucubratiunculis excudendis Et statim ad nidorem hypocaustorum
grauiter aegrotare coepi : idem mali genus quo laboraui quum hic
essem proxime. Conualueram, sed ex interuallo repetiit nos morbus
priore grauior.

Iamdudum expecto quem exitum sit habitura Lutherana tra-
goedia. Omnino spiritu quodam res geritur ; an ex Deo sit nescio.
Ego, qui nunquam fauerim Luthero, nisi quomodo fauet qui hortatur
ad meliora, vtrique parti sum haereticus. Apud nostros pauci
quidam aliis de causis inimici, etiam Caesari persuadere conantur
me caput esse huius tumultus, non alio argumento quam quod non
scribo aduersus Lutherum. A Lutheranis proscindor in profes-
sionibus quasi Pelagianus‚ quod plus tribuam libero arbitrio.
Nonne belle mecum agitur ‘?

mv. of Beme, belonged to an influen-
tial family, and.thus was able to acquire
abundant preferment. He was Provost
01 Solothurn in Dec. 1500, Prior at
Vaucluse in the diocese of Besancon
1502, Prior of Grandson 1506, Provost
of Lausanne 1506, Dean of Basle, and
on 28 May 1519 Coadjutor to the
Bishop. In 1504, being in Rome on
an embassy‚ he was created Apostolic
protonotary; and on 29 March 1509
he was Dr. 01 Canon Law at Siena
His election as Coadjutor was vehe-
mently opposed by the nobility 01 the
diocese on the ground of his connexion
with Berne; and so in Dec. 1526,
partly for this reason and partly because
he disapproved of the persecution of
Lutherans, he resigned, still, however,
retaining his Deanery. Any inclina-
tions he had towards reform did not
lead him far; for he refused to par-
ticipate in the Disputation of Berne
in Jan. 1528, and in consequence was
deprived by the Beme Council in May
1528 01 two cures he held in the Rhone
valley, Aigle and Bex (Herminjard 216,
235, 237, 239). He withdrew to Besan-
qon, and spent his remaining years in
retirement.
