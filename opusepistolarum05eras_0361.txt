1384] To ULRioH ZWlNGLI 327

taken from the original, which he supposed to have perished 3 nor can it have been
taken from Fiissli, since it supplies some of his gaps, but misses some words
which he prints. The difficulty of the manuscript may be judged from the
fact that even Kohler’s text in Zw. E2. is not perfect. Some extracts are given
by J. H. Hottinger in Primitiae Heidelberqemes, 1659, p. 220, and in Hist. eccl.
N. T. sec. aevi, ii, 1665, pp. 28-31.

The last paragraphs are a postscript written on 1 Sept. ; cf. l. 4911. The year—date
is easily supplied from the contente. The letter indicates that Zwingli was now
becoming critical of Erasmus, and that the sympathy which had hitherto existed
between them was coming to an end. It is in fact the last which survives of their
correspondence, though Erasmus wrote again soon: see Zw. E2. 319, Zwingli to
Oecolampadius, 11 Oct. 1523, ‘ Erasmus pridem bis ad nos scripsit, de te honestam
in vtraque epistola faciens mentionem. Vna enim sic ait, “ Oecolampadius apud nos
triumphat ''.']

S., optime Zwingli. Grata mihi fuit tue epistole confabulatio.
Rumor huc allatus est etiam tercium illum Augustinensem exustum
postrid. Visitationis. Nam pridie eius diei exusti sunt duo. Quorum
mortem an deplorare debeam nescio. Certe summa et inaudita
constantia mortui sunt, non ob articulos sed ob paradoxa Lutheri ε 5
pro quibus ego mori nolim, quia non intelligo. Scio pro Christo
mori gloriosum esse. Nunquam defuit piis afflictio, sed affliguntur
et impii. Et πολύτεχνος est ille qui se subinde transfigurat in
angelum lucis. Et rarum est donum discretio spirituum. Lutherus
proponit quaedam enigmata in spetiem absurda: ‘ omnia opera 10
sanctorum esse peccata, que indigent ignoscente Dei miseri-
cordia ’ ; ‘ liberum arbitrium esse nomen inane ' ; ‘ sola fide iusti-
ficari hominem, opera nihil ad rem facere '. De his contendere,
quomodo velit intelligi Lutherus, non video quem fructum adserat.
Deinde video in plerisque illi addictis miram peruicaciam. Et in 15
Lutheri scriptis quantum maledicentiae, sepe preter rem. Ista me
cogunt subdubitare de spiritu illorum ; quem ob causam, cui sanem,
velim esse syncerum. Nullum monitorem serunt3 imo moniti se
referunt in partem diuersam et inuoluunt hominem quauis occasione.

unsigned and unaddressed letter from

2. Augustinensem] Cf. Ep. 1382. 46—
9. The allusion is to the burning at
Brussels on 1 J uly—after confinement
at Vilvorde since July 1522-οέ two
Austin friars from Antwerp, Henry
Vos and John van den Essehen, by the
inquisitore, on the ground that they
had embraced some of Luther's opin-
ions. A third, whose name is unknown,
was condemned, but not burnt at the
same time; and his fate is uncertain.
For the rumour reported here cf.
LE2. 684 and n, also Herminjard 7 5.
Two German narratives of the event
and one Latin—all printed at the time
—are reprinted with elaborate intro-
ductione by F. Pijper in Bibl. Reform.

to the Latin narrative, which gives thc

an eyewitness, dated Brussels, 10 July
1523. It has been suggested (cf. Pijper
pp. 24‚5) that this was written to Eras-
mus : but there is no evidence in either
direction. A brief account of the affair
is given by Erasmus in a letter of 1 J uly
1529 (Lond. xxiv. 4, LB. 1060). See

(sescla. i, 1900, 40-52.
