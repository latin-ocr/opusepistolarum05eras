1312] TO J OHN VERGAR A 125

non vulgarem spirantes. Certum est sequi consilium tuum. Non
est animus congredi cum singulis, presertim Stunicae similibus et
Caranzae: quorum tu probitatem et eruditionem multis verbis5
predicas mihi. Et fortassis habent in pectore, certe in scriptis
nusquam apparet. Tamen hic quoque mihi placuit ingenii tui
ciuilitas. Caranzae respondi, et Stunicae, duobus maledicentissimis
simul et indoctissimis libellis. Restant ab illo promissi tres. Sed
promisi me non responsurum. Collegium Card<inalium> vetuerat 10
ne illius libellus, cui titulus ex re, Blasphemiae, excuderetur.
Excusus est clam per monachos quosdam, quibus 1110 hanc agit
fabulam. Rursum vetitus est vendi: adeo placet Ecclesiae
primoribus, Mihi posthac animus est a tali scabie abstinere vngues.
De te, mi Vergara, summam, mihi crede, spem concipio ex illa tua 15
epistola, quae nihil vulgare aut mediocre pollicetur. Fefelleras
hactenus me. Non suspicabar te tantum habere sodalitatis cum
Vtriusque litteraturae Musis. Bene vale.

[The course of Erasmus’ correspondence with Duke George at this period was
interrupted by the action of chance brigands 01· of deliberate enemies; either
Lutherans acting against the Duke, or, as Erasmus supposed lat-er (Ep. 1437. 90-5),
Eppendorff proving false. The present letter failed to reach the Duke, and accord-
ingly three months later Erasmus dispatched a duplicate copy made from the
rough-draft remaining in his own hands, accompanying it with another brief letter
(Ep. 1325). Both arrived safely; and Duke George duly sent a reply (Ep. 1340).
But that again was intereepted; and so for more than a year no letter passed
between them. In the spring 01 1524 Erasmus made another approach to the Duke,
with complaints of Eppendorff (Ep. 1122 introd.)‚ in a letter delivered in May,
which has not survived. Duke George replied with Ep. 1448. sending also a copy
of Ep. 1340. These were delivered on 20 Sept. (Ep. 1499) ; and thus communica·
tion was re-established.

For this letter the best source is a contemporary copy at Louvain (α : divided
into οι1 and αξ 101 1110 11181 hand and a corrector), probably made at Basle from the
rough-draft retained by Erasmus (see p. 83). Besides this the duplicate copy
sent to Duke George is preserved at the Dresden State Archives in the same
volume as Ep. 1283 : written by a seeretaryffl) and corrected by Erasmus (13²).
The recto, which ends at quam in l. 62, has its right-hand edge much worn, 10
an extent varying from two to eleven letters ; but as the missing words or letters
