esseque sollicitum quod aeger significares te scripsisse. Cancel-
larium tibi impendio fauere dixerunt mihi homines etiam ex vulgo
aulae.

Has literas vides centonibus coagmentatas3 nam vt quicquid
cognoueram, ita scribebam. Sed tu huiusmodi mauis, quibus 70
certior de omnibus fias, quam accuratas illas in quibus nihil sit
praeter ciuilitates.

Cum apud me esset heri Hilarius, venit ad me Hispanus de
Leodiensi<s> familia, narrauitque ipso Hilario audiente nullum
hodie viuere sub coelo hominem, cuius Leodiens<is> sit amantior 7 5
quam tui; habere semper opera tua in manibus, lectitare sedulo
ct admirari, propugnare te, si quis calumnietur, non secus quam
aras et focos : se crebro coenis et prandiis interfuisse, vbi excitata
de te mentione ita te tuumque nomen et eruditionem aduersus
Italos quosdam defendisset, vt facile appareret te illi esse quam 80
chariss<imum>. Hilarius tuus diligentiss<imus> fuit in requirendis
responsis ab iis ad quos scripseras; sed genius huius aulae est
mirus dilator et procrastinator.

Augustinus meus aduentu amicorum aulicorum depositus est
tantisper e manibus ; vbi primum hine abierint, conuolabo Loua- 85
nium. Ibi quam citissime addam extremam manum ; desunt enim
quinque libri tantum. Nam Frobenius habet XV11. Commendo
tibi Hilarium hune, condiscipulum 011111 Parisiis meum; quem
arbitror alioqui tibi esse commendatissimum.

[Τ110 year-date is confirmed by the mention 01 Schinner as living3 101 though
subsequently Erasmus may have been misinformed about the fact of his death
(01. Epp. 447. 59611, 1410 introd.)‚ the mention here clearly is derived from Filo-
nardi’s letter. It is evidmt, too, from ll. 8-9 that the meeting at Constance in
Sept. 1522 (see below) had not yet taken place.

Ennio Filonardi (0. 1466-19 Dec. 1549) was born 01 humble parentage in the
village of Baueo among the Hernican mountains. After education at Veroli and
then at Rome, he entered the service 01 the Curia under Sixtus lv c. 1484, and
gradually rose to Papal favour. Alexander Ἦ 1113ᾶο him Bishop of Veroli, 4 Aug.
1503; and Julius 11 employed him as Viee—legate of Bologna and Governor of
Imola. In 1513 Leo x sent him as Nuncio to Switzerland, to support Schinner in
holding the Swiss to their allianee with the Papacy against Franee ; and in 1514
he went there again with fuller powers as Legate de latere. During this period his
head-quartem were at Zurieh. In Aug. 1517, through the influenee of a Freneh
party in Rome, Ant. Pucci (Ep. 860) was sent to supersede him ; and Filonardi
then spent some years in retirement at Rome. In May 1521 he was restored to
favour, and sent back to work with Sehinner in Switzerland: where in Nov. he
was seized at Frcnch instigation and held prisoner for a montll. Consequently
in April 1522 he transferred his residence from Zurich, which was now inclining
rapidly to the Reformation, to Constance, to be in 3 Catholic region and near the
