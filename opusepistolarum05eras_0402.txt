vota si valerent, omnibus bonis floreret tua maiestas et sub te
rengnum longe florentissimum. Codicem recentem adhuc ab officina
statim misi ad Christianiss<imam> M. T. per Hilarium famulum
meum, fidelem et in bonis litteris non vulgariter doctum, qui olim
Tolose diu professus. Per hunc si congnoucro mcum studium tibi
fuisse gratum, vehementer gaudebo. Dominus Iesus maiestatem
tuam diu seruet incolumem ac florentem.

Basle.
25 December 1525.

[The preface to a commentary on Prudentius' hymns for Christmas and Epi-
phany; printed with Ovid’s Nux (Ep. 1402), Basle, Froben, ¹524 (α). For this
also there seems to have been no authorized edition until the Basle Opera, 1540,
vol. v, p. 1 120(B). As the book was in ‘the press on 17 Feb. 1524 in preparation
for the spring fair (VE. 380; cf. Basle MS. C. vla. 73. 229), itis evident that the
year-date here is of a year beginning at Christmas.

For Margaret Roper see Ep. 999. 174n.]

Margareta, tam sanis, tam argutis, tam modestis, tam candidis, tam
amicis, vt etiam si quis titulos detrahat, Thomae Mori γνήσια τέκνα
possim agnoscere. Ne vero semper videamini cecinisse surdo,
studiis quibus obruor, paululum otii suffuratus, hisce diebus
Nataliciis, paraui munusculum quod spero vobis non ingratum
futurum.

Quod felix' faustumque sit, Guilielmus Roperus, ea morum inte-
gritate, suauitate modestiaque praeditus, vt, ni sponsus esset tuus,
germanus videri posset, dedit tibi auspicatissimas coniugii primitias,
aut, si mauis, tu illi dedisti: vel vt verius dicam, vterque dedit
alteri παιδίον quod dissuauietur. En mitto tibi et alterum puerum
multo auspicatissimum, Iesum nascentem Iudaeis et mox illuce—
scentem Gentibus, qui connubii vestri prouentum bene fortunabit 5.
