>192 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1524

que nec dictare, vt alius rescripsisset, nec nos scribere permittebat ;
iam autem paulo mitius nobiscum agens, saltem nos rudi nostro
more, vt alius in literas recipiat, permittit. Quidquid sit, boni
consulat prestantia vestra.

Cogitauimus interim de prefato Misericordiarum opere, admodum
nobis placente. Et certe consultum nobis visum esse vult, quod
ctiam sie fieri maximopere rogamus, vt, si in publicum spargi
debeat, extranee materie a nostra nihil addatur, maxime quod vel
Lutheranis vel syncerioris pristine fidei obseruatoribus animum seu
etiam nauseam faciat, et nos hanc vel illam sectam amplecti declaret.
Videntur quidem nobis nonnulla in calce dicti operis adiecta, vt
cum prestantie vestre venia loquamur, talia esse. Quamobrem
efflictim precamur, prestantia vestra eadem tollat et rescindat.
Causam nos impellentem seimus, aliquando coram exposituri.
Faciat hac in re prestantia vestra iuxta nostram summam con-
fidentiam, et nobis ad vota sua semper imperet, beneque in Domino,
quem pro inuicem rogemus, valeat.

Ex castro nostro Pourrentrut xiii Iulii Anno etc. xxiiii.

Viro nulli comparando, nobis in Christo tanquam fratri charis·

1465. To WILLIAM WARHAM.

Hieronymi Epistolae i, 1'0. AA v0. Basle.
Jortin ii. 536. 15 July 1524.

[The preface to Erasmus’ revised edition of Jerome, Basle, Froben, 1524-6, in
nine volumes (α) : dedicated, like the first, of 1516 (see Ep. 396), to Warham. The
Letters, which were Erasmus’ particular portion, were undertaken before the rest
(cf. ll. 6-7), and were in the press on 18 April (1524) (Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 13. 135).
The first volume, which contains this preface, is dated 1524, and is entitled Opus
Epistolarum . . . Hieronymi . . .‚ vna cum scholiis Des. Erasmi Batai-odanti, denuo
per illum non vulqari cura recognitum, correctum ac locupletatum. Vol. ii (Ep. 1451)
and vol. iii (Ep. 145 3) have prefaces dated six weeks earlier ; but as each is dated
on its title-page Aug. 1524, it seems likely that all three were completed about the
same time, for the September fair at Frankfort. For financial reasons (cf. Ep.
1488. 57-60) the remaining six volumes followed more slowly. Vol. iv (Ep. 1504)
and vols. v-viii appeared in 1525 (ef. Ep. 1623); and the latest date in the
whole edition is Feb. 1526 (cf. Epp. 1675, 1678, 1704), found in the colophon
of vol. ix and in a preliminary section, of two gathorings. placed at the head of this
first volume of letters, when the whole was ready. This thus became the first
volume of all, with a new general title, Hieronymi Lucubration& omnes . . . multo
quam ante viqilantius per Des. Erasmum Roterodamum emendatae, placed in front of
the special one given above. The arrangement of the contente of the three
volumes differs considerably from that of the 1516 edition (cf. Ep. 396. 299—316) ε
for an earlier scheme see Ep. 308. 5-9. In addition to his index for the Letters
(Ep. 1453 introd.) Conrad Pellican made a full index for the rest of the work.
He completed it in the winter of 1525-6 (CPR. p. 105) ; and it was printed at the
end of vol. ix, and not, like Oecolampadius’ for the edition of 1516, in a separate
volume (Basle, Froben, May 1520).

The next edition of Erasmus’ Jerome was printed in Paris, 1533-4, nine vols. (6),
by Chevallon; with whom, through Froben’s death, Erasmus had come into
connexion (see Trans. of the Biblioqraphical Soc. xiii, 1916, pp. 316-17). In
fi also, as in α, vol. i has two titles3 each of which is used to impress upon the
reader Erasmus' ‹zo-operation in the work. The second, dated 1533, repeats the
