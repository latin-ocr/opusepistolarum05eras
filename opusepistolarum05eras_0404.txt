368 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1523

(ZKG. xvi, 1896, pp. 491725). ssy the end 01 Oet. hc had achieved his purpose
(cf. HE. 263. ξ) 4, 264. § 5) and was proposing to go to Wit.tenb0rg (LE2. 461n);
but it is not known whether or no he went. For a time he entered the service 01
Hutten (01. ΗΕ. 334, p. 340. 41-4), who provided him with a curacy near Steckel-
berg, at Steinau on the Kinzig above Hanau (sce Steitz in Arch. s. Franksurla
Ges-cle„ NF. iv. 118, vi. 124, mcntioning correspondence with the pastor 01 Steinau ;
which I have not seen) ; but in the spring 01 1522 110 took shelter with Nesen at
Frankfort. On 1 July Jo. Indagine, parish-priest 01 Steynheim (Ep. 661. 3311),
addreqsecb to him some Introductiones . . in chyromanliam, Strasburg, J. Scott,
1522, ⁰. ² v0.

As a result 01 attacks made on him at Frankfort as an Evangelieal preacher
(01. HE. 280—3‚ 287) he set out in July for Zun'ch to join Zwingli (Zw. E². 215),
but was detained by friends at Neuenburg on the Rhine, between Basle and
Breisach, and persuaded to become preacher (Zw. ΕΞ. 278). At the request 01 the
head of the J ohanniter house there he delivered an oration on bchalf of the Knights
01 Rhodes, Basle, Cratander, March 1523. On 8 March 1523 he dedicated to
a local magnate some Annotaciones llebraz'cae on the Old Testament (Bodleian
MS. 111, never printed), in which he again extols Erasmus; but his Von dem
Euanqelischen Anstoss, s. 1., with a preface dated from Neuenburg, 28 Oct. 152 3,
shows that he had become strongly Lutheran in sympathy.

Another composition 01 this period was a letter to the Bishop of Basle on behalf
of a parish-priest near Neuenburg, maintaining that Verbum Dei multo magis expedit
audire quam missam. In 1523-4 he was appointed headmaster 01 the town-school
at Strasburg, a post which 110 1101(1 101 about nine years3 and on 26 March 1524
was admitted citizen 01 Strasburg.

The present attaek 011 Erasmus in (10101100 01 the friend to whom he was loyally
attached, did not make a lasting breaeh. In spite 01 0 brief desertion of Luther for
Carlstadt (LE2. 8 54, 885), his devotion to learning outweighed his interest in reform.
In 1525 he offered Erasmus an olive-branch (cf. BRE. 239), which was accepted
(Ep. 1614). During his time at Strasburg he edited the works 01 Hus (LE2. 827,
832, 915), 1524-5, from manuscripts that had belonged to Huttcn ; and in 1525-8
produced some educational and Biblieal compositions. Taking to medicine, he
edited first L. Phries’ Spieqel der Artzuey, Strasburg, J. Grieninger‚ 1524, and the
Anatomice of Alex. Benedictus of Verona, Strasburg, «1. Herwagen, March 1528.
In 1530 Schott at Strasburg printed 101 him the first part 01 his most famous book,
Herbarum vinae 010οη03, designed to promote the study 01 simples; and this was
followed by translations from Serapion, Averroes, Rasis, and Paul 01 Aegina on
the same theme. In 1532 he became M.D. at Basle, and in 1533 was appointed

J. Herwagen, March 1533, is dedicated by Nic. Pruckner to Brunfels ; whose De
diffinitionibus astroloqz'ae is included in the same volume, following the preface.
