[Τ110 preface to an edition of Cicero's Tusculanae Quaestione& Basle, Froben,
Nov. 1523 (α). There is a later issue, perhaps authorized by Erasmus, Basle,
1536 (BEr1.), which Ι have not seen. Subsequently this preface was included
among Erasmus’ letters in N; cf. Epp. 1000 introd.‚ 1013.

It is found also in one of the Gouda manuscripts (App. 9) ; where, however,
one page, ll. 12-40‚ is missing. But though the manuscript has a few variants
of note, they are hardly sufficient to make it clear that, as in some other cases
(cf. Epp. 325, 1193, 1206, 1225, 1239), the copyist was not following the printed
text of a, with which it agrees in the title and in l. 57. Even the dates at the
endere very likely coniectural, obtained from the colophon of α. For these reasons,
though it is probably nearly contemporary (see vol. i, p. 612), the manuscript
has no great value. For convenience Ι have placed it as β at the end of the sigla,
after LB.

Erasmus’ work was perhaps begun at Louvain; for one of the manuscripts
that he used for this edition was borrowed from Julian Carbo (†c. 1523), an
Austin canon of St. John's near St. Trond in 1500 (Mazarine MS. 1565 fin.), then
of Thronus beatae Mariae, at Owen near Herentals, and later confessor to the
nunnery of Jericho in Brussels: an enthusiast for Cicero, whose works he had
copied out almost complete with his own hand, though not very accurately (see
Horawitz v. 51, 72). The task of collating manuscripts having been entrusted to
servant-pupils, Erasmus' part of deeiding between variant readings and adding
notes eost him only two or three days (ll. 6—1 7).

For his earlier work at Cicero see Epp. 152, 1013,

John of Vlatten or Flatten († 11 June 1562) belonged to a branch of the Merode
family which took its name from the village of Vlatten, near Zulpich, sw. of
Cologne. He matriculated at Cologne 17 July 1516 as ‘ Dns. Wlaten, beate Marie
Aquensis canonicus ’ : preferment which he had already received on 30 June 151 5
from Duke John 111 of Juliers (l. 143), who on 26 Jan. 1517 appointed him also
‘ scholaster ’ at St.. Mary’s. In 1519 Vlatten was RA. at Cologne, and then studied
law, 1521-4, at Orleans, Paris, and Freiburg: during which period he received,
23 Dec. 1521, the provostship of St. Martin’s at Cranenburg, W. of Cleves. At
Freiburg (11. 121-2) he renewed his acquaintance with Erasmus, perhaps begun in
1520 (cf. Ep. 1170. 47), and met Conrad Heresbach (Ep. 1316); who dedicated
his Strabo, Basle, Val. Curio, March 1523, to Vlatten as a patron to whom he
was deeply indebted. By 1524 he had become counsellor to the Duke of Cleves
(Ep. 1467). 111 1525-6 110 went to Bologna to renew his legal studies (Knod 4005) ;
and visited Rome. On return he resumed his duties as counsellor, and was employed
for the remainder of his life on political and diplomatic affairs3 retaining, however,
his position as ‘ scholaster ’ as late as 1536. In 1535 he was given the provostship
of Xanten, in 1541 that of St. Mary’s at mahen, in 1544 that of Kerpen, w. of
Cologne, in exchange for Xanten3 and in 1554 he succeeded Gogreff as Chancellor
of J uliers.

His friendship with Erasmus lasted unbroken. The Ciceronianus was dedicated
to him in 15283 and in return he sent a ‘ puteus argenteus ’ which was among
Erasmus’ possessione in 1534 (Basle MS. C. VI2. 71, f. 4; printed by L. Sieber,
Mobiliar des Erasmus, 1891, p. 7 ι cf. EE. 85). 111 1532-3, when Duke John under-
took a visitation of the churchcs in Cleves and ι11111015, with a view to the introduc-
tion of moderate reform, Vlatten persuaded Era-smus to send a consilium in general
terms (EE. 183 ; cf. LB. App. 512) 3 in return for which the Duke, who since 1529
had been inviting Erasmus to settle in his dominions (EE. 105), granted him an
annual pensiori of 30 florins. But a request for more specific recommendations met
with no response (LB. App. 373).

In consequence of these relations Vlatten, when he became Chaneellor, was
at varianco with the Lutheruns; especially with Hamclmann, who endeavoured
to bring him to a new ‘interpretation ’ of Duke John’s ‘ Erasmian ’ ordinances
for church government. Sec Hnmelmann's Geschichtl. Werlce, cd. Κ. Lbffler, ii
