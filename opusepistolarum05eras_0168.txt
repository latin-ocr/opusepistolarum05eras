Ι1101114110 Lethmatius or Laetmatius (0. 1492-6 Dec. 1555) of Gouda, completed
a brilliant career at Paris University by standing first on the D.D. list at the
Sorbonne in 1519 or 1520: sce Ep. 1238. 2411. 111 Sept. 1522 (Ep. 1350. 8) 110
500111011 from Adrian VI a canonry at St. Mar) 's in Utrecht: as the result of his
own prompt application to Aleander, 18 Jan. (152 2>( Vatican MS. Lat. 6199. 90),
and an uncle' s appeal to the Pope (Ep. 1350. 12 14). In 1525 110 was sent to sup-
press heresy at Amsterdam3 500 Fredericq iv, p 302, v, p. 87. In Oct. 1530 110
became Dean of St. Mary s, and m 1534 Vicar- Genera] for the diocese. He was in
trouble* m Sept. 1535 for having bartered away to the Duke of Gueldres a ‘unicorn' s
horn' belonging to St Mary’ 5, and was imprisoned and compelled to procure the
restoration of it (Ant. Matthaeus, Sylloqe E Ρῑςίοῖανιιηι 1695, pp. 331- 5); but
his position at Utrecht does not seem to have been impaired. He was greatly
concerned for the healing of the religious dissensions of the time. In 1544 110 pro·
duced a treatise De instauranda reliqione libri ir, Basle, Jo. Oporinus, dedicated
to Charles v; a Su-spirium siue desiderium matris Ecclesiae super redinteyranda
reliqione in 35 books, which was never printed, is mentioned by Alard of Amsterdam
(Ep. 433 : see van Heussen i. 33) in th‘e preface to some translations from Theophy-
lact-a volume which I have been unable to trace. See also VZE. 162; but
Zuichem thought him ‘plus satis cerebrosum' to be sent as a delegate to the Council
of Trent (VZE. 147).

See I. W<alvis>‚ Beschwyviny der Stad Gonda, 1714, pp. 2 50-8 3 C. P. Hoynck,
Analecta Βείρίοα, iii. 1 (1743), pp. 292-3; and van Slee in ADB. xviii. 458-9.
Th. J . Almeloveen, Amoen. theobphzlolofflcae, 1694, pp. 61-93, prints some letters
to him (Epp. 1345, 1359; 011(1 others from Dorp, Pighius, and Fisher, bp. of
Rochester) from a 1115. collection at Gouda: Fisher's letter, which replies to
criticisms on a book, having been printed first in Fzscherii Opera, Wurzbmg,
1 597, pp. 1704- 7. Erasmus, too, writes of consulting him on theological questions
(Ep. 1581), and praises him at the same time in the Apol. adu. dehac cli. Satoris
(LB. ix. 788 D). But apart from the present series of letters there is little trace
of communication between them· , unless the suggestion that Lethmatius was
the collector of the Gouda MSS. (see vol. i, pp. 612,13) is correct. There is
another letter from him to Aleander, 1 5 32, in the Vatican MS. Lat. 6199. 89.]
