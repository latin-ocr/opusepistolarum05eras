100 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1522

Ep. 1293 introd.) An edition by Cervicornus at Cologne‚ 1532 (β), has some
corrections, which arc adopted in a more complete revision made 101· 1110 second
Froben edition. 1537, 8⁰ (γ). Itis possible, therefore, that they should be ascribed
to Erasmus: though it was unusual for him to have relations with the Cologne
printers. The correction made in N* (l. 395) is noticeable, as a sign of later revision.
The dates of this prefaee need no confirmation.

The MS. from Franckcntal (ll. 30—34) which Erasmus used, may be identified
unquestionably with thc only one 01 1110 Commentary now known 10 exist ; which
isin the Vatican Library (Pal. Lat. 160: xc.)‚ brought thither in 1623 with thc
rest 01 1110 Palatine collectione. Not only does it contain (ff. 128, 119 v0, 68 v0,
58 v0, 86) all the readings cited by Erasmus in ll. 159, 174, 194, 316, 323, except
that in l. 174 it has Xpm (Christum) for ipsum (111111), 111 l. 316 insacicns; but
further, Mgr. Mercati has pointed 0111 10 1110 that other Palatine MSS. (c. g. 203—5,
a xivss. Augustino) came 110111 Franckental. The MS. was perhaps procurcd for
Erasmus by Maternus Hatten ; 01. Ep. 1289. 1811, 20.

As nothing 01 either Arnobius‚ the African rhetoric-ian (iva), or his younger
namesake had yet appeared in print, it is not surprising that Erasmus should have
confounded the two, and have ascribed the Commentary to the African (01. ll. 1 78-80)‚
who was the better known. In editing Arnobius at the end 01 xvic. R. L. dela Barre
incorporated a large part 01 this preface into his own without acknowledgement.

At the foot 01 10. t⁶ in a, where Arnobius ends, the date August 1522 is given3
and then follows a commentary by Erasmus on Psalm 2. His work on the Psalms
had begun with Ps. 1 (Ep. 327) 3 and now that he had resumed it, he was led on
in ensuing years to similar treatment of Pss. 3, 4, 14, 22, 28, 33, 38, 83, 85. To
Ps. 2 110 wrote no preface, an omission which may be attributed not to any special
fitness in adding it to Arnobius‚ nor to any desire to enlarge the matter dedicated
to Adrian, but to the ill-health which is described in detail in Ep. 131 1. In place
of a dedication to this second part 01 the book, a small part 01 fo, t⁶ v0 is occupied
with a preface in Froben’s name, which Erasmus perhaps composed (cf. Epp. 396
11111οᾶ., 602) ; the rest 01 1110 page being left blank.

10. FROBENIVS CANDIDO LECTORI S.

Praesulum quorundam efflagitatione permotus Des. Erasmus Roterodamus
aggressus fuerat olim coeptos in Psalterium commentarios absoluere, atque hac
foetura nobis aliquot Psalmos erat daturus ε sed partim aduersa valetudo, partim
sycophantarum quorundam improbitas, obstitit quo minus praestaret quod animo
conceperat. Hoc tamen quod erat paratum, ne intercideret, Arnobianis com-
mentariis velut auctarium quoddam adiecimus. Visum erat et illi hoc ceu specimine
exhibito studiosorum explorare iudicium antequam altius opus ingrediatur. Est
aliquid suo placere theatro. Fruere lector et nostrae saue industriae.

A bound copy of Amobius was carried 101 Erasmus 10 Rome by the Basle
public messenger: whom Adrian rewarded with six ducats 101· his pains. See
