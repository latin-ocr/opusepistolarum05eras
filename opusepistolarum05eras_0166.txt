,136 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1522

inciderem maxime verebar ; neque vero id praestitisse aut scripsisse
saltem adhuc fuit integrum. Obfuerunt etenim fata quae hie mihi
25 omnia confuderunt, peregrinationes item et aduersa valetudo. Ν 1100
autem quia licet, quod decet facio. Scribo, etsi ineptius quam vt
te aut legere aut audire conueniat ; scribo tamen, ne non praestem
quod debeo : hoc est te ne non salutem et quam exoptem valetu-
dinem tibi prosperam contester ; ad haec, ne mea te lateat conditio,
30 qui omnibus ad te confugientibus vel re vel opere certissimus sis
Mecenas. Hic est nihil quod agam. Qui literas amet, apud nos est
nemo, immo vero qui eas vel olfecerit, aut ridiculus est aut odiosus.
Quid velim, iam inde colligis ε 1110 alio Velle proficisci, ne 1110 0010
marcescam. Nam quam aut docere aut doceri potius, nihil est
35 omnino quod malim. Quare te 1100 vnum effuse rogo, si quem scias
mea opus habere opera, aut literis aut verbo digneris significare.
Vale Montisbeligardi nouembris pridie nonas Anni Iesu 1522.

[The year-date is confirmed by the visit to Oonstance. As to the circumstances
of Erasmus' proposed migration to France, Lefranc points out (Η ist. du Coll.
da France, pp. 8 5—8) that there can have been no question at this time of renewing
the invitations of 1517 (see Epp. 522, ete), since Francis’ projects for the founda-
tion of a trilingual college were still in abeyance ; and he suggests that the proposal
to come to France had emanated from Erasmus himself, who was growing increas-
ingly dissatisfied with the ‘ tumults’ of Basle (cf. ¹Epp. 1293. 1311, 1327. 11—12).
Erasmus writes fully of the negotiations in Ep. 1342. 541—95. That the proposal
was never carried out may be attributed, not to any lack of warmth in the reception
of it, but to his own hesitation and indecision produced by his present ill-health.

Francis (c. 1489-22 April 1562) of Toumon on the Rhene, belonged to one of
the leading families of the Vivarais. At the age of 12 he joined the Augustinians
at Vienne, and later as a commander in the Order attracted the notice of Francis 1,
who speedily took him into his service and advanced him 10 the Church. He held
successively the sees of Embrun in Dauphine 1517, Bourges 1525, Auch 1538, and
Lyons 1551. In 1530 he was made Cardinal, and as Bishop of Sabina 1550 and
Ostia 1560 he rose to be Dean of the sacred College. He served on numerous
embassies, one of which was to secure the release of Francis 1 in 1526; and he
played a considerable part in the politics of his day. He was a favourite with
Margaret of Valois; but later used his power relentlessly for the persecution of
heretics. Germ. Brixius dedicated to him a translation of Chrysostom’s Contra
Gentiles, Paris, S. Colinaeus, 1528 ; Aleiati a treatise De verborum siqnificalione,
Lyons, S. Gryphius, 1 5 30; John Tilius of Angouleme Κανόνες τῶν Ἀποστόλῶν, Paris,
G. Neobarius, 1 540. Other proteges were Dion. Corron (1.290), J 010010 Fundulus(Ep.
1733 introd.) and the famous critic Lambinus ( 1 516-72). In 1 552 110 founded a college
at Tournon, which he designed to make the nucleus of a university; but finding
