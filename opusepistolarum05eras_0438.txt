Ofp John Haner of Nuremberg little is known before this time. His name is
found at the end of the long list of living theologians praised by Pirckheimer in
Aug. 1517 (HE. 64). A1ter sympathizing for a while with Luther's movement
(11. 15-18 : cf. ZKG. xviii. 242) he reacted to the conservative side, and on 5 Jan.
1524 wrote to Clemcnt vn with the concurrence of John Faber (cf. ll. 3-4) offering
suggestions for the settlement oi the religious conflict and urging ‘ vt Erasmum
Roterodamum ac Eduardum Le[t]um‚ viros certe nostra aetate et eloquentissimos
et doctissimos, quibuscumque officiis S. T. demereatur atque etiam in hanc arenam
ingenti policitatione pertrahat. Nam maxima pars nostrae Germaniae Erasmi
tantum sententiam sequitur, sola eruditionis ac litterarum opinione ducta,
etiam si per se pauci rem discusserint, quanquam etiam et his viris ingens iuditium
sit; vnde facile speratur non tantum multos persuasuros hos. sed et causam ab
aduersariis euicturos ’ (Balan p. 319).

On 14 Feb. 1525 Haner was appointed preacher at the cathedral in Wurzburg ;
but he vacated the post about the end of the year because the Bishop (for whom
see Ep. 1124) objccted to his free criticism of the Church. Thence he went to the
court of Philip, landgrave of Hesse, whom he moved towards conciliation at the
Diet of Spires. He opened correspondence with Oecolampadius and Zwingli
(Zw. ΕΖ. 529, 5 55, 561, 597) ; but his attitude was so uncertain that on return to
Nuremberg in the autumn of 1526 he met with only a cool reception. By 1532
he had broken entirely with the Reformers (Al. E. i. 82), and was casting about
for preferment. Cochlaeus made many attempts to obtain this for him, through
Alcander, and from the Abp. of Mainz and Duke George of Saxony. To the
Abp. Haner dedicated De nouae leqz's sacrificio, which remained unpublished
(Abla. d. bayer. Alcad. iv, 1866, p. 698) ; and Cochlaeus at his own expense printed
for him Prophetia vetus ac mua, Leipzig, M. Blum, 1534, dedicated to Duke George.
But without avail, for the Duke disliked those who had once been Lutherans.
Lee, however, whose acquaintance Haner evidently had made at this time (ef.
Ep. 1408. 2411) sent him money from York in 1334 (ZKG. xviii. 248). 111 conse-

was appointed preacher in the cathedral. The rest of his life was spent there,
in prosecution of his studies and polemics: a commentary on Galatians, and
