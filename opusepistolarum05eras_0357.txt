1382] FROM JOHN BOTZHEIM 323
cum tu etiam maiora ab illis merueris, tametsi plerumque pessima 5
merces contingat a quibus optime sis meritus; sed memineris
aliquid diuinae misericordie relinquendum esse quod remuneret vel
condonet. Scribis numerosam multitudinem amicorum tibi 01 81)
antiquo fuisse, et his aliquot accessisse. Scias hos omnes esse
paucissimos, si comparaueris his quos venturis subinde seculis es
habiturus. Inuitant te plures pro odiosissimo negotio tractando.
Periculum est ne ferueat affectus, vt plus velint vindicatam iniuriam
8111 Regis quam auctam gloriam Christi.

Secretarii consilium placet. Is, quisquis 081, 0011811111 studio tuo
salutari 01 quieti quam vbique praedicas. Diceris conductum 13
organum multorum papistarum, nec 81110 graui periculo tuorum
librorum, qui vellicabuntur passim a quouis etiam cerdone. Meo
consilio suspendes omnes illos ad vnum aut alterum annum, vt
solebas hactenus ; nisi malis esse signum, ad quem plurimi mittant
spicula. Monitore non eges, cui plus satis 081 ingenii pro eo 2
ne 0110.

His correspondenoe, which is detailed
with care in EE, shows that he was
a friend 01 Vadianus, Zasius, and pirck-

tance with him later, and dedicated to
him an edition 01 Algerus of Liege.
