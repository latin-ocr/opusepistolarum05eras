A DDENDA AND CORRIGENDA

Vol.. Ι

P. 135, Ep. 37. In the Town Library at Gouda is a copy of Erasmus’ Jeronie,
1516, which was boqueatlied to the Library of the Brethren of the Common
Life at Gouda by Rud. a Munneckedam, at one time vice-pastor of St.
Jolin's Church, † 11 July 1546. In vol. 9 (E. 2. 1ο) 011 the verso of the last
leaf is written by an early xvie hand, perhaps c. 1519 (see addendum to
Ep. 1110 infra), a copy of Ep. 37. The following variants may be noted:

Trr. imnAsnvs
1. cepisti. 4. fecerant (so also the Hertogenbosch ΜΞ).
3. hiis. 11. opus.
Besides these corrections the ms. has value in helping to authenticate the
collection of 19 letters for which Dr. Karthon has discovered that Leclerc
was using the Hertogenbosch MS: see vols. i, p. 608, iv, p. xxiii.

V011. ΙΙ

Ρ. 546, Ep. 574. Dr. J. F. M. Sterck of Haarlem possesses a contemporary
ms. copy of this letter3 which vat-illatos between α and β, but follows α

αβ.

contains Ep. 1252, has a copy of Ep. 760, written at the end of the book by
the same xvie hand. It oonfirms the corrections of LB. in ll. 1, 4, 5, and

P. 24, Ep. 1000 introd. A copy of H. Gravius' Cyprian, 1544, is in the Library
of St. VValburga's at Zutphen. His comment on the De duplici martyrio,
printed in the margin of p. 434, is: ‘Cuiuscunque praesens de duplici
martyrio liber sit, viderint qui eum Cypriano tribuerunt. Cypriani non
esse, ex consequentibus paulo post liquido constabit, praeterquam quod
phrasis ipsa Erasmum aut quempiam Erasmo similem referat potius quam
Cyprianum '.

P. 278. Ep. 1110 introd. In a volume of Jerome now belonging to the Town
Library at Gouda (see addendum to Ep. 37 supra) are bound up sixteen
folios of ms. containing a draft of the Antibarbari earlier than that which
Erasmus published, in amplified form, in May 1520. It is headed Liber
apoloyeticus Desiderii Herasmi Roterodami, in quo refelluntur rationes inepte barbaro-
rum contra poesim et literaturam secularem paynantium. At the end the copyist,
perhaps one of the Brethren of the Common Life at Gouda, concludes:
ιτελοσ. Finitum anno domini xvc et xix in translatione beati Benedicti
(11 Ju1y> ad vsum et librariam doinus fratrum collationis in Gouda'.

P. 411, Ep. 1168 introd. Hegendorfer's arrival in Poland must be dated shortly

bp. of Plock, expressing pleasure at his coming (Kornik ΜΞ. 243, s. 222).
