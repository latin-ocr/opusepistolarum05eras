non esse pernegandum sacerdotibus in posterum ordinandis, si
continere non queant, nec aliud dicerem si cum summo Pontifice
agerem3 non quod non praeferam continentiam, sed quod nullos
pene videam qui seruent continentiam. Sed interim quorsum opus
est tanta sacerdotum turba ⁵? Nulli fui autor vt duceret, sed nec
vlli fui molestus volenti ducere.

Si monachus cum cuculla simul deponeret omnem maliciam, non
obsisterem quo minus qui vellet abiiceret. Nunc passim abiiciunt
temere nullaque maiorum autoritate, qui ex malis monachis fiunt
deteriores laici. Nec aliud his praestat mutata vestis quam vt
impunitius patrent quicquid animo collibuit. Sunt, fateor, quorum
indolem melioribus rebus natam premit cuculla. Sunt rursus
eo nati ingenio vt decem cucullis cohercendi sint potius quam suo
tradendi arbitrio. Certe multos alebat cuculla, qui nunc veniunt
in periculum ne magistra egestate discant tollere vnde non oportet.
Quid autem dicas de his qui prouecta aetate, dissuadentibus amicis,
scientes, prudentes, volentes dediderunt sese cucullae? Saltem
istos pudeat inconstantiae. Nunc vt· praeclarum facinus iactant,
et alios ad suum exemplum pertrahunt.

Sed his de rebus alias. Valebis in Christo.

[A preface for a friend's book, printed by a friend, Doe'ctionarins Graecus . . .
inqenti mcabulorum numero locupletatus per vir-iusque literaturae non vulqariter peritum
Iacobum Ceratimzm, Basle, J. Froben, July 1524, folio ; a somewhat rare volume,
of which there is a copy in the University Library at Cambridge (Aa*. 2. 24. C).
Ceratinus' work seems to have been done at Louvain (cf. Epp. 622. 31n, 1437. 155—
8); but he had now moved to Brussels (Ep. 1461). The fact that he sent no
preface with his contribution (ll. 29—30), and Erasmus' statement (l. 28) that the
impulse had come from himself. shows that, though Ceratinus' name appears alone
on the title-page, his part in the book cannot have been large. The proposal for
the whole undertaking had very likely been made by Froben (cf. Ep. 885. 10-13).

Thc progress of Greek studies at this time is shown by the steady output of Greek-
Latin lexicons. The earliest to be printed was the work of the Carmelite John
Craston or Creston of Piacenza ; which appeared first at Milan during its author‘s
lifetime, not later than 1478 (Proctor 5962), and formed the basis of many of those
that followed. Five other issues were printed in Italy before 1500 ; one of which
was by, Aldus, Dee. 1497, with an index of the words arranged in Latin—Greek
(cf. ll. 38-41). The demand grew steadily, and the researches of scholam added
contributions of importance (cf. Ep. 885. 10-13). Mazochius' issue mentioned
there was followed by Gourmont’s, Paris, 13 Dec. 1512. edited by Aleander;
by Cartander's, Basle, 24 March 1519, editcd by Val. Curio (Ep. 1514. 2211) ; by
Resch’s‚ Paris, July 1521 (cf. Ep. 1328. 4511), edit-ed by Beraldus (Ep. 925); by
val. Ourio’s. Bane, March 1522, which was greatly amplified in March 1525
(cf. Ep. 1433. 2n); and by Gourmont’s‚ Paris, April 1523, tho editing of which
was begun by Du Maine (l. 12n) and completed by Chaeradamus. Each in t-urn
made use of its predecessor, without the least regard to copyright‚ and claimed

 

 

it to Luther: see OED. xm. It occurs Bl. E. 45, 49 of 1522 ; sce also l. 83n‚
in the Papa. Babylonica (Ep. 1153. and Epp. 1332- zo„ 1382. 16, 1413. 19.
14on) und LE2. 375, both of 1520; in 1443. o, 1496. 195, 1523. 79.
