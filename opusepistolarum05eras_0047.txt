1260. FROM JACOB ZIEGLER.

Breslau MS. Rehd. 254. 167. Rome.
EE2. 13 : LB. App. 320. 16 February 1522.

[An original letter, autograph throughout. Two extractS, ll. 23-49, 55-74‚
, are printed in LB. from Fecht (see vol. iii, p. xxiv) ; and the preceding and con-
cluding portions are given by P. Kalkoff in Arch. f. Reformationsqesch. iii. 65-8 3,
with an introduction. The letter appears 101· the first time entire in EE2. The
Latin of it is sometimes difficule, and has been misleading to translators.

Jacob Ziegler (c. 1471-1549) of Landau on the Isar received his first education
in the Cistercian monastery of Aldersbach in Lower Bavaria‚ and was admitted
there ‘ acolytus '. On 23 Sept. 1491 he matricuhted, with two younger brothers,
at Ingolstadt, where he came under the influence of Celtis and Locher (Ep. 224. 2n)‚
and also became deeply interested in mathematics and astronomy. On 18 June
1493 he was B.A.‚ and after taking his Μ.Α. 110 entered the theological course
in Sept. 1499. In 1500 he left Ingolstadt‚ and nothing is known of him (but cf.
l. In) till March 1504, when he composed‘a work on spherica] astronomy at
Cologne. In these early years he usually Latinized his name as Lateranus. From
Sept. 1504 until the death of Celtis in 1508 he was at Vienna ; and then became
tutor to a young man, Henry Kuna, later Provost of Olmutz; with whom he
spent three years on an estate in Moravia‚ and one, 151 1-12, at Leipzig. During
this period he composed his first printed work, an attack upon the Bohemian
Brethren (l. 13011). In 1514 110 was at Vienna again ; and then till 1520 at Buda,
working at Pliny and Ptolemy under the patronage of Ladislaus Szalkan, bp. of
Waitzen, and corresponding freely with the Italian scholar, caelius Calcagninus,
who was then in attendance on Hippolytus of Este (1. 12811) at Erlau¹ 70 1118. NE.
of Buda (see Calc. R). From 1521 to 1525 he was in Rome, Calcagninus having
procured him an invitation from Leo x. But before long he found himself in
sympathy with the moderate German Reformars, and hostile to the Papaey3
which he attacked in such compositions as the Historia Clementis VII. He remained
in Italy till 1531, spending most of his time with Calcagninus at Ferrara, and
working hard at astronomy and mathematics. In August of that year the fruits
of his long labours on Pliny, a commentary on H. N. bk. ii, were printed by H. Petri
at Basle. In Nov. 110 settled at Strasburg, where the town gave him a pension
to enable him to continue his studies: and in 1532 P. Opilio published for him
there a notable geographical work, on the Holy Land, containing also a disquisition
on scandinavia, in which he described the massacre at Stockholm and vigorously
denounced its author, Christiern 11 (800 Ep. 1228. 30n). By Feb. 1534 he was
disillusioned as to the possibilities of reform, and withdrew to Baden as tutor,
till 1539, to a young son of the Margrave : an attempt to secure admission to the
court of Albcrt of Brandenburg at Mainz having failed. But his return to the
Catholie party was genuine enough for him to be appointed Professor of Divinity
at Vienna in 1541 and Dean of the Faculty in 1343. From that year until his death
he enjoyed the hospitality of Wolfgang of Salm, bishop of Passau; occupying
himself with Scriptural commentarios, the geography of Africa, and treatiscs on
eomets and rainbows: some of which he published with a dedication to the
Bishop, Basle, J. Oporinus, March 1548. Apart from this letter and Ep. 1330
and his reply to Stunica (l. 203n), fow traces romain of his relations with Erasmus.
