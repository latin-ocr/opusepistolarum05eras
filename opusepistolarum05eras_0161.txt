1315] ‘ro ULRICH ZWINGLI 131

One of Erasmus' motives in leaving Basle was the care of his health, with which
the local wines did not agree (Ep. 1311. 24—5‚ 39*40); and his intention now was
to go on to Rome, in response to his numerous invitationS. But a bad attack
of stone, which came on soon after he reached Constance, compelled him to avoid
the fatigues of so long a Journey, and he returned to Basle about the end of
September, forgoing also an expected visit to Zurich (cf. Zw. E2. 2 37). On his way
out, or home, his reception at Schaffhausen was flattering (BRE. 2283 cf. lv.
362,3). At Constance Botzheim's hospitality was splendid ; and he was welcomed
almost royally by men of every degree and standing. All this he describes with
evident enjoyment, and with an unusual amount of topographical detail, in
Ep. 1342. 3 3 3-45 7 z and in the colloquy, Ichthyophaqia, first printed in Feb. 1526,
but seemingly written earlier, there is also a short account of it (LB. i. 805 Ε-806 Α).
See also Epp. 373 introd, 1316, 1319, Cat. Luc. (1, p. 46. 18-25); and lv. 360-2.
It appears from BRE. 227 that Botzheim even went to the expense of putting in
an open fireplace for him.]

S. Eruditissime Zuingli. Legi paginas aliquot Apologetici tui.
Obsecro te per Euangelii gloriam, cui scio te vnice fauere, et omnes
quotquot Christi nomine censemur, fauere debemus, vt si quid
aedes posthac, rem seriam agas serio, et memineris Euangelice tum

modestiae tum prudentiae. Consule doctos amicos antequam5

aliquid edas in vulgus. Vereor ne ista Apologia conciliet tibi
magnum periculum et Euangelio officiat etiam. In his paucis que
legi, multa sunt de quibus Volebam te admonitum. Non dubito
quin tua prudentia sit hec boni consultura ; scripsi enim animo tui
studiosissimo, ad multam noctem. Bene vale.

[The year-date is amply confirmed by the mention of Erasmus' visit to Constanee
and of Glareanus' marriage.

Conrad Heresbach or Hertzbach (1—2 Aug. 1496—14 Oct. 1576) of Mettmann,
between Diisseldorf and Elberfeld, after education at Miinster under Murmellius
(Ep. 838. 2n)‚ matriculated at Cologne in Oct. 1512 and was M.A. 1515. To
study law he went to Franco, where c. 1517 (cf. Ep. 664) 110 read Plato with Lupset
in Paris (Oratio de lit. Graecis, f. 14 v⁰); and in 1519 110 returned to Cologne as
LL.B. In Dec. 1520 110 was established at Basle as corrector for Froben (VE. 226),
and was thus perhaps partly responsible for the inaccuracies in Velleius Paterculus
(cf. BRE. 188, 197); but in June 1521 he was appointed Professor of Greek at
Freiburg (Schreiber, Gesch. Univ. Freiburq, ii. 193: cf. MHE. iii. 48,9). His
inaugural Oratio de literis Graecis was edited by Sturm, St-rasburg‚ 1551. As 110
is described, on his appointment, as ⁵ Erasmi alumnus ’‚ it is possible that he had
been with Erasmus at Louvain in 1519-20. 011 15 March 1522 he was still at
Freiburg (MHE. iii. 51,2) and again in June and July (cf. Ep. 035. 2011) ; but then
went off to Italy, where 110 became LL.D. at Ferrara, 22 Oct, and visited Padua
and Venice (Oratio, f. 21 v0). He resumed work at Freiburg till May 1523, when he
resigned because the University would not raisc his salary (Schreiber ii. 194).
During this period he revised the current translation of Strabo, and translated
bks. iii and iv of Gaza’s Greek grammar : which Val. Curio printed for him at Basle
