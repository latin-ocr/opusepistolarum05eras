160 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1522
Imputant hoc cuidam theologo, qui me amat etiam ignotus ignotum,
quem aiunt apud Pontificem posse omnia. Pontifici veris rationibus
agenti Christi negocium, adero modis omnibus, pro mea quidem

45 quantulacunque portione. Nec dubito quin, vt est senex doetus,
praeterea rerum plurimarum vsu peritus, sit responsurus nostrae
expectationi. Si quid fefellerit, ego certe non ero seditiosus.

Nunc ad extremam concionatoris interrogaffiunculam, An totum
Euangelium sit deserendum? Primum hi maxime deserunt, qui

50 male defendunt; deinde quam lente suam doctrinam Christus
prodidit! Quid autem insanius quibusdam istis qui nunc videri
volunt Euangelici‘? Admonui amicum tibi non incognitum dc
epistola Episcopi Constantiensis vexata. Nunc exiit nugamentum
longe dementissimum. Demiror quid isti cogitent aut quid sibi
velint.

55 Cronbergius bis mecum est colloquutus, et valde placuit ho-
minis modesta prudentia. Huttenum non vidi, 1166 1106 tempore
videre cupio. Optime illi volo, si bene velit sibi. Mihi est aliud
quod agam. Scripsi tibi simul et Fabro. Beatus adhuc abest.

6 nobleman of sturdy independence of
character, who early gave his support
to the Reformers: following the lead
of Francis of Sickingen, whose kinsman
(not son-in-law, as in Ep. 1342. 696) he
was. In May 1521 he threw up a post
that he held under the Emperor, in
protest against Charles' condemnation
of Luther at Worms (LE2. 432. 38—40).
In the ensuing disgrace he was encou-
raged by Luther to stand firm (LE2. 494,
511) ; and he showed the vigour of his
spirit by facing without dismay the loss
of his hereditary castle in Oct. 1522
(cf. Zw. ΕΖ. 252). During the next
year he wandered much: first with
Oecolampadius (cf. Oec. E„ f. 209 vo),
whose changes at Ebernburg (cf. Ep.
1308. 26n) he had supported (cf. LE2.
568), to Basle, where he had two inter-
views with Erasmus (Ep. 1342. 696);
afterwards, c. 24 Feb„ to Wittenberg
(cf. ME. 232 with LE2. 627) and
Bremen (Zw. E2. 292) ; in Aug. 1523 to
Constance and Zurich (Ep. 1382. 44-
5); and in Sept. settling with his wife
and mother at Basle (Krafft p. 54). It

57. Huttenum] On 28 Nov. 116 had
just arrived in Basle (Zw. ΕΖ. 252 =
HE. 298), and he left again on 19 Jan.
for Mulhausen (Oec. E„ f. 209: HE.
3063 cf. Ep. 1437. 24-39); having spent
there ‘dies plus quinquaginta' (Ex-
postulamb= HE. 310, g 4), staying in
the inn Zur Blume (Am. E. 15).
Erasmus sent through Eppendorff
a transparently fictitious excuse for
not inviting him to see him: which
became the subject of much 1661111111ιῆ-
tion between them. See the Expostu-
latio and the Sponqia (ΗΕ. 310 and 333),
also Epp. 1342. 689-96, 1356, Α111. Ε. 15,
and VE. 334 ; and the contentions with
Eppendorff in 1527-8. Ep. 1496. 6-13
reveals that what Erasmus really
fea-red was lest Hutten and his com-
panions should settle down in his house
as impecunious guests of whom he could
not get rid.

59. Beatus] He was at Schlettstadt
on business, and did not return until
atter Hutten’s departure (l. 57n).
Hutten had visited him there on his
way to Basle in Now See 871671ρὶ11,
