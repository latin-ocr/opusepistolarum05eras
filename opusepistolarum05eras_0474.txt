Vatican Archives MSS. (αβγ). Rome.
Vatican Library MS. (δ). 3 April 1524.
Louvain MS. (ε).

[of this letter there are four iuss. in the Vatican Archives; firstly Sadoleto's
autograph minute (α), and secondly a contemporary copy by a secretary, which
evidently was official (β), both 111 the same volume, Arm. 44, vol. 9, ff. 23 and 19 ;
also two xviic. copies, Miscell. Arm. 1, vol. 17, f. 40, following β, and Arm. 32,
vol. 1, f. 257 (7)-a slight-ly more cautious form which may represent the letter
actually sent. Besides these the Vatican Library has two ms. copies : oue (Lat.
9064, f. 346) contemporary, following β, but incomplete, ending at doctrinam tuam
(ll. 1 1-1 2),611(1 the otherffi: Barb. Lat. 1499, f. 299 v0, printed by G. Br0m‚Archivazia
in Itali& ii, 191 1, p. 350) os xviie, perhaps by the same hand as -γ, An introductory
note almost identical for ’γ and δ, gives as the source : ‘ Ex ipsarum minuta reposita
inter scripturas quondam domini Blosii, olim secretarii apostolici,
quae conseruantur 111 secretaria apostolica domestica apud d. Caesarem Glorierium
(Glorerium ὃ) secretarium’ (cf. Ep. 831. 7511). See also Ep. 1506 introd. The
letter was first printed by P. Balan, M onumenta Reform. Lutlwranaa 1884, p. 324,
froin ·γ; 611(1 then again in his Allon. saec. :nvi hist. illustrantia, 1885, p. 10, from cz,
which 116 seems to have discovered in the interval.

In addition to the manuscripts mentioned above, the volume in the Vatican
Archives which contains α and β, has also an autograph minute by Sadoleto and
a contemporary official copy (ff. 20, 21) of a longer form of the same letter, with
the same sentiments but ampler verbiage. As it lacks dates, this form presumably
was discarded in favour of α ; and so the differenees, which are unimportant, need
not be recorded here. It is printed in Balan’s second volume, p. 12.

There seems to have been some delay in the dispatch or delivery of this letter;
ior it is first mentioned by Erasmus in Epp. 1466, 7 of 2 1 JuIy, not having appeared
in Ep. 1452, 3 June, of which Ep. 1466 is largely a repetition. News of it had
ieached Porrentruy by 21 July (Ep. 1468. 24-5), 111 a letter of Erasmus which may
have been of the same date as Ep. 1456, 20 June.

Besides these documents at the Vatican, 6 MS. of the letter (ε) exists on Erasmus’
side : among Cranevelt's papers at Louvain (Gran. E.)‚ with a date at the end of the
month. The MS.‚ which is not free from blunders, is contemporary, by a rather
ohildish hand, evidently (cf. Ep. 1546) of one of Erasmus’ servant-pupils. As it
preserves the customary heading as well as the usual formal phrases in full, and
