532 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1524

111 endeavouring to identify the handwriting ; but hitherto without success, beyond
establishing that it is not either Merula's or Dan. Heinsius’, both of whom printed
the letter to P. Vulcanius, in Οι and the Elzevir Illuet. vir. Epistola& 1617. But
the writer may without doubt be connected with Leiden ; for in addition to the
evident association with the well-known Leiden antiquary, Bonaventura Vulcanius
(1538-1614)‚ tho title-page is stamped with the mark of the Collegium Alumnorum,
whichhwas founded at Leiden in 1591 by the States of Holland as a seminary for
reae ers·

p A copy of the letter—evidently not the original, since it had two obvious blunders,
needing correction—was communicated to Leelerc, just in time for inclusion at
the very end of LB., by J. J. Battier, ‘1.V.D.‚ Eloquentiae Professor atque
Basileensis reipubl. iurisconsultus ’. The Athenae Rauricae, pp. 147—8‚ 323, states
that Battier (1664-1720) became ‘ Reipublicae Syndicus ’ in 1695, and ‘ Eloquentiae
Professor' on 22 Sept. 1696. Ηο very likely derived the letter from Capito’s
papers. which were at Basle earlier in the century (see Ep. 938 introd.) ; but as
he made a journey to Germany, Belgium and England in 1691, it is not impossible
that somewhere on his tour he may have seen the manuscript 111 the copy of Ν2
above mentioned, and a few years later have sent it to Leelere. As against this
latter suggestion it must be noticed, however, that Leclere omits the striking
signature ε which he would hardly have done if it had been in Battier's copy.

The year-date given by Leclerc, and presumably also by Battier‚ is impossible,
as by Sept. 1529 Erasmus had left Basle. There is sufficient verbal resemblance to
letters of this period to substantiata 1524, in view of his relations with Capito
at this time z ef. Epp. 1429. 2011, 1437. 99n, 1459. 61-72‚ 1496. 69-70, 108-9.]

ERASMVS ROT. WOLFANGO CAPITONI S.

To‘r coniecturis ducor vt seientia sit magis quam suspicio, te,
quemadmodum Othonem prius, ita nune Epphendorpium in nos
immittere. Queso vt istis artibus vtaris in eos qui tibi male volunt,
potius quam in Erasmum. Nescis quantum possim la-edere. Satis
est tragoediarum, etiamsi nihil accedat. Laboro pro negocio
Euangelieo multo syncerius quam tu credas. Nam vestrae ecelesiae
nunquam dabo nomen nisi aliam videro. Bene vale et isti iuueni
da melius eonsilium.
