556 LETTERs OF ERASMUS [1524

and there came under the influence ot Luther and Melanchthou; also lecturin
on Quintilian. ln April 1524 he J'ourneyed South with Melanehthon, and visite}
Erasmus at Basle (Epp. 1443, 1444. 211. 1445); but his inclination was towards
Luther, who states in his Table-Talk that the final spur to him to write the De
Seruo Arbitrio (Ep. 1667 inti-od.) came from Camerarius. In Oct. 1524 Camerarius
left Wittenberg and returned ho1ne; and during the turmoils of the Peasants'
Revolt he was away in Prussia. ln 1526 through the commendation of Melanch-
thon he was appointed Rector oi the newly founded town· school at Nurembe
and the rest of his life was given to teaching—till 1535 at Nuremberg, then at t e
invitation of Duke Ulrich of W urtemberg at Tubingen till 1541, and finally on
Princo Henry of Saxony' s imitation at Leipzig.

His liter-ary activity was very great. He translated into Latin the principal
Greek elassics, and wrote commentarios on Sophocles, Cicero, and Plautus, the
last of which was highly praised by JOS. Scaliger. He help ed Durer with the

publication of his books; and also wrote a work on comets, histories of the Schmal-
kald War of 1546, and of the Bohemian Brethren (Ep. 1117 introd.)‚ with whose
position 110 was in sympathy; and biographies of Prince George of Anhalt, of
Melanchthon, and of Eobanus, whom he devotedly admired, and of whose letters
he issued three small volumes, now very scarce‚ to supplement EHE. But no
collected edition of Camerarius’ works was ever published. The last extant letter
from Erasmus to him is dated <c 5 Feb. >13 -28,

ERASMO ROTERODAMO.

ETSI non putaui hactenus me quicquam scribere ad te oportere,
cum mea ipsius caussa, tum pulcherrimarum tuarum occupationum
respectu; ne et ipse meam infantiam de nihilo proderem, et, qua
in parte minime daebere-m, mei officii parum rationem habuisse
viderer: tamen postquam inihi Philippus Melanchthon duos locos
ex tua epistola, quam paucos ante dies abs te scriptam accepit,
quod in ea mei mentio habita esset, recitauit, mutaui sententiam 3 et
mei hac in parte cura abiecta, et humanitate tua animique facilitate
fretus—quia non posse me, salua fidei meae existimatione tuaque
erga me beneuolentia, ea in quibus mei memineras, tacita prae-
terire videbam,—tibi meis lit-teris (ita enim est dicendum) obstrepere
statui. Quod ipsum perquam paucis a me factum est, vt vel hoc
modo, si quid alioqui peccatum a me esset, corrigerem ac emendarem.
Ego tibi, vir clarissime, magnas ago gratias quod tanti me feceris—
quem ex vno isto congressu, ne quid de me acerbius dicam, contemnere
certe poteras—‚ vt nondum penitus mei oblitus. salutem m litteris
optimi et eruditissimi viri meique amantissimi adscripseris. Magni
istud mihi beneficii instar est, neque minus eo mihi placeo, quam
quod ad te confabulatum et (le quibus voluissem rebus communica-

2 tum nuper sum admissus.

Quo in amplissimo merito commemorando mire intellexi te
modestum fuisse, adque tui calumniam vsque, qui non dubitaris
scribere parum te liberaliter nos ac cumulate tractasse. Quid ergo
